2226,0,Asiana President Says Pilot Was in Training,"Any challenge to the pilots would have been further complicated by the shutdown of a ground-based electronic system called a glide slope indicator, which helps keep planes at the correct descent angle."

2226,0,Asiana President Says Pilot Was in Training,"Both Asiana and Korean Air have been gradually hiring more nonveterans, including foreign pilots, partly because there were not enough South Korean Air Force veterans to meet the rising demand for pilots — especially in recent years, when they expanded overseas routes as budget airlines joined the competition for the domestic market."

2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"CAIRO — Egypt’s new leaders struggled to put together a new government on Saturday, with disagreements over who should be the interim prime minister spilling out into public view and showcasing the divisions among those who had endorsed the overthrow of the country’s first democratically elected president."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"State news media initially reported that Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Prize-winning diplomat and a vocal critic of Egypt’s last three leaders, had been chosen as prime minister, a move that would have given the generals who ousted President Mohamed Morsi a head of government likely to appeal to the country’s liberals and to the West."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"But within hours, the fissures that had vexed Mr. Morsi’s rule re-emerged to undo the reported decision."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"The ultraconservative party Al Nour, the one Islamic faction that had backed the military takeover, said it would refuse to work with Mr. ElBaradei because of his liberal views."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Around midnight, after hours of contradictory news coverage, the new interim president then backed away from the earlier reports that Mr. ElBaradei had been offered the job."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"The continued chaos underlined the struggle for stability in Egypt, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the Arab Spring revolution that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak in 2011."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Since then, Islamists and liberals have battled for power, even after Mr. Morsi and the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood won multiple rounds of elections."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Mr. Morsi was ultimately unseated by the country’s generals on Wednesday for failing to bring Egypt’s political factions together, with many saying that the Islamists had taken too much power."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"But with the reports that Mr. ElBaradei had been named prime minister on Saturday, the pendulum appeared to have swung the other way."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Although the military ousted Mr. Morsi in the name of national reconciliation, Mr. ElBaradei’s apparent rejection underscored the difficulty a military-appointed government may have in bridging Egypt’s divides."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Mr. ElBaradei, who is respected worldwide for his work on nuclear issues for the United Nations, was a strong advocate of toppling President Mubarak, but has not enjoyed wide popularity on the Egyptian streets."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"He had considered running for president after Mr. Mubarak’s fall, but when he dropped out, disappointing his liberal supporters, many assumed that it was because he was unlikely to win."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Signs emerged almost immediately Saturday that the reported appointment was not final, with state TV making only passing references to the news and the Web site of Egypt’s flagship newspaper, Al Ahram, saying that the selection would be announced at a news conference that never materialized."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"“This is how it is with a revolution,” said Rania Azab, a news media adviser for Mr. ElBaradei, 71, who insisted late Saturday that he had been chosen to form an interim cabinet."

2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Speaking as the political struggle unfolded in Cairo, he said that the United States was “not aligned with, and does not support, any particular Egyptian political party or group.” Much of Saturday’s confusion played out on the Web of state news media built by Mr. Mubarak to shape Egyptians’ views of the world and their government’s role in it."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"The television stations and Web sites have struggled at times to find their role under Egypt’s successive rulers since Mr. Mubarak’s fall: first the military, then Mr. Morsi, and now Adli Mansour, a little-known jurist appointed president by the military."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,Al Ahram reported that Mr. ElBaradei had been charged with forming a government and that he and his ministers would be sworn in once the full cabinet was formed.
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"State television referred only briefly to Mr. ElBaradei’s appointment, showing a video of a news conference he held without broadcasting his remarks."

2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,A reporter for the national news service snapped that all had been invited to see Mr. ElBaradei being officially named prime minister.
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"“There is no name for a prime minister up to this moment,” Mr. Muslimani repeated, smiling sheepishly."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Asked whether Mr. ElBaradei was still a candidate, he would say only that a decision would be reached soon."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"The political breakdown came as Egyptians buried their dead and treated their wounded while struggling to come to terms with the widespread street violence that began on Friday and left more than 30 people dead and 1,400 injured."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Rubble, shattered glass and spent shotgun shells littered intersections and bridges in Cairo, where battles between Islamist supporters of Mr. Morsi and those celebrating his removal had raged into the early morning."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Many were shocked by the level of violence and by the abundance of guns in the hands of the combatants, whose stark disagreement over who should be ruling the country followed them into hospital wards."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"A Coptic priest was shot dead in the northern Sinai Peninsula, and a video circulated showing what appeared to be Islamists pushing two youths from a concrete tower atop a building."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"The violence was the most widespread since the revolution that toppled Mr. Mubarak, and many feared that it would make it harder for the country’s populace to again accept the authority of a single leader."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"“We have no idea what’s going on,” said Muhammad Ahmed, 27, standing near the bed of a friend, Muhammad Ali, in Qasr al-Aini Hospital in Cairo."

2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Four bodies had been brought to the hospital, and another person had died in the emergency room."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Most disconcerting, Dr. Abu Aisha said, were the 15 people who had arrived with gunshot wounds, indicating a presence of guns among protesters that many in Cairo would have once found unthinkable."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,Dr. Abu Aisha said the hardest part was the continuation of street fights in the sprawling hospital’s wards.
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"“There were dead and wounded from both sides, and they wanted to finish each other off, so they beat each other inside the hospital,” he said."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"“There is no agreement and everyone is sticking to their views and we can’t come up with a plan to move the country forward.” Also Saturday, security officials said Khairat el-Shater, the powerful financier and strategist of Mr. Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood movement, had been arrested."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,Prosecutors ordered the detention of him and three other prominent Brotherhood members on charges of inciting violence against protesters.

2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Mr. Mansour, a former chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court, has spoken publicly only once since his swearing-in."
2228,0,Egyptian Nobelist Is Chosen to Be Prime Minister,"Islamist supporters who consider Mr. Morsi’s removal a military coup continued their sit-in in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City and in front of the officers’ club of the Republican Guard, where some believe Mr. Morsi is being held."

2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,Independence Day is an important holiday for all Americans.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"Each July Fourth we celebrate that moment in history when the Second Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence -- the earth-shattering document that asserted man’s natural right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” -- and the new nation’s declared sovereignty from the humiliating tyrannies of an imperial power."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"But it’s also worth mentioning, too, that the impending success of the “American experiment” was hardly a foregone conclusion -- despite what so many of us believe today or perhaps were taught in school."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"“No event in American history which was so improbable at the time has seemed so inevitable in retrospect as the American Revolution,” historian Joseph J. Ellis wrote in his Pulitzer Prize winning book Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"Indeed, Americans today perhaps just assume that under the leadership of Washington, Adams, and Jefferson -- during those early and chaotic years -- the United States would eventually become, in Ellis’ words, “the oldest enduring republic in world history.” Not so."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"“No one present at the start knew how it would turn out in the end,” Ellis argues, least of all the Founders themselves."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,This is a fact I suspect most of us overlook.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,And yet the United States today is the beau ideal for many developing nations.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"Our most cherished political institutions -- a bicameral legislature, an autonomous judiciary, and a duly elected chief executive -- serve as a template for burgeoning democracies everywhere."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"Clearly, the United States has created, over time, a framework that has ushered in unprecedented opportunities for advancement and social mobility."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"For example, when the nation was founded in the late eighteenth century, there were only 2.5 million people living in the United States."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,Today there are more than 300 million.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,One hopes that this is precisely what the Founders imagined when they spoke about forming “a more perfect union” -- a fluid yet imperfect society that is continually developing and growing and becoming more prosperous.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,But it seems to me we are facing a perilous future.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,Too many of us seem to disregard the Founders as nothing more than “dead white men” -- statesmen who most notably failed to secure citizenship rights for all Americans and resolve the slavery question in their own time.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"Liberals, for their part, often scoff when conservatives show even the slightest hint of reverence for the nation’s Founders and the principles they embraced."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,"But those progressives forget, perhaps, that the 56 delegates who founded the nation established, for all of us, the very pillars of freedom and opportunity that make living in the United States today so highly regarded throughout the world."
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,If for no other reason -- on this quintessentially American holiday -- this is why we should celebrate and remember them.
2230,1,Why We Remember the Fourth of July,We have much to be grateful for.

2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"But General Sisi sought to present a very different image from the anonymous, numbered communiqués from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that were solemnly read over state television to announce Mr. Mubarak’s exit, and the general emphasized that the military had no desire to rule."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"“The armed forces was the one to first announce that it is out of politics,” General Sisi said at the start."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"“It still is, and it will remain away from politics.” Under a “road map” for a post-Morsi government devised by a meeting of civilian, political and religious leaders, the general said, the Constitution would be suspended, the chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Adli Mansour, would become acting president, and plans would be expedited for new parliamentary and presidential elections under an interim government."

2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,And state television resumed denouncing the Brotherhood as it once did under Mr. Mubarak.
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"Moments after the General Sisi spoke late Wednesday, Mr. Morsi released a short video over a presidential Web site delivering a final, fiery speech denouncing the ouster."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"“I am the elected president of Egypt,” he declared."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"“I am ready to sit down and for everybody to sit with me and to negotiate with everybody.” “The revolution is being stolen from us,” he repeated."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"Minutes later, the Web site was shut down, the video disappeared and he e-mailed journalists a statement “as the president of the Republic and the Chief Commander of the Armed Forces” urging all to follow the rules of the recently approved Constitution."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"Then he called the takeover “a complete military coup which is categorically rejected by all the free people of the country who have struggled so that Egypt turns into a civil democratic society.” And in a sign of how little Mr. Morsi ever managed to control the Mubarak bureaucracy he took over, the officers of the Presidential Guard who had been assigned to protect him also burst into celebration, waving flags from the roof of the palace."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"Although the tacit control of the generals over Egyptian politics is now unmistakable, General Sisi laid out a more detailed and faster plan for a return to civilian governance than the now-retired generals who deposed Mr. Mubarak did two years ago."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"General Sisi made no mention of any period of military rule and granted the acting president, Mr. Mansour, the power to issue “constitutional decrees” during the transition."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"Mr. Mansour was named to the bench by Mr. Mubarak two decades ago, before Mr. Mubarak sought to pack the court with more overtly political loyalists or anti-Islamists."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"Mr. Mansour ascended to the post of chief only a few days ago and, while he is said to be highly regarded, not much is known of his views or how much authority he will truly wield."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,General Sisi called for the formation of a “technocratic government” to administer affairs during the transition and also of a politically diverse committee of experts to draft constitutional amendments.
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,It was not clear who would form the government or the committee.
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"The general said that the constitutional court would set the rules for the parliamentary and presidential elections, and the court would also “put forward a code of ethics to guarantee freedom of the press and achieve professionalism and credibility” in the news media."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"The general’s plan bore a close resemblance to one proposed in recent days by the ultraconservative Islamist Nour Party, and suggested that he was seeking to bring in at least some Islamists as well as liberals and leftists to support the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"The Nour Party, which quickly endorsed the plan, had joined other political groups in accusing Mr. Morsi and the Brotherhood of monopolizing power at the price of a dangerous political polarization."
2231,0,Army Ousts Egypt’s President; Morsi Decries ‘Complete Military Coup’,"But unlike liberals, the ultraconservative Islamists were keen to avoid the installation of a liberal like Mr. ElBaradei as a transitional prime minister, or to see the current Constitution — with its prominent recognition of Islamic law — scrapped instead of revised."

2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","Updated 06/12/2013 11:32 PM EDT Controversial surveillance practices that spilled into public view through a series of dramatic leaks last week have helped to avert “dozens of terrorist events” in recent years, National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander told a Senate committee Wednesday."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","However, the longer the NSA director spoke before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the less clear it became just which surveillance programs he was crediting for those successes."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles",Story Continued Below His answer came in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) about call-tracking surveillance conducted under Patriot Act Section 215.
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","( PHOTOS: Pols, pundits weigh in on NSA report) Alexander said it was difficult to segregate information obtained under that provision from another practice disclosed by leak last week: a system that gathers bulk data from internet providers, e-mail services and social media sites."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","That system is aimed at foreigners outside the United States, though it sometimes data from Americans or foreigners on U.S. soil is swept in as well."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles",“These authorities complement each other.
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","The reality is, they work together,” said Alexander."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles",It was also not clear whether Alexander was attributing the prevention of dozens of terrorist events to the phone-call tracking program or to the use of Section 215 more generally.
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","Beyond the mass collection of phone records revealed last week, that provision can be used to acquire a variety of business records."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","“Clearly, this authority is being used for something more than phone records,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","However, Alexander made it clear there are limits to the NSA’s surveillance Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked whether it was true that the NSA had the ability to tap into Americans’ phone calls and electronic communications."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles",“False.
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","I know of no way to do that,” Alexander responded."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","The NSA chief, who is also a four-star Army general who oversees the U.S. Cyber Command, said he is pressing to declassify information on how often the information has been useful."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","“I’m pushing for that,” he said."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","“We do want to get this right and it has to be vetted across the community so what we give you, you know, is accurate.” Leahy complained that the intelligence community has been dismissive of past congressional efforts to rein in the practices."
2251,0,"NSA chief defends dual cyber, intel roles","The “intelligence community has told us we obviously don’t have the ability as simple senators to know things as well as you do,” Leahy said, paraphrasing what he’s been told about NSA’s programs as: “Congress shouldn’t tinker with it at all."

2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"WASHINGTON — As the Senate voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to begin debating an overhaul of the nation’s immigrations laws, President Obama offered a wholehearted endorsement of the bipartisan proposal, which presents him with a chance to reach the kind of landmark accord with Republicans that has eluded him on the budget and gun violence."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"For Mr. Obama, who has picked his shots in the immigration debate to avoid stirring partisan anger on Capitol Hill, it was a moment of promise and peril."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"While he threw his weight behind the bill, he conceded that it would not satisfy all sides and said he anticipated a bruising fight over issues like border security and the path to citizenship."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"The president, however, may have more leverage than in previous battles, not least because many Republicans believe rewriting the immigration laws is critical for the long-term viability of their party given the nation’s demographic shifts, even if doing so risks alienating parts of their base."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"Republican willingness to weigh significant changes in immigration policy was evident in the 84-to-15 vote to begin what is expected to be a monthlong debate on the bill, a lopsided majority that comprised 52 Democrats, 2 independents and 30 Republicans."

2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"Not Democrats, not Republicans, not me.” Though the Senate’s Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, often an impediment to Democratic initiatives, voted to allow debate, he said he would vote against the bill unless major changes were made."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"“These include, but are not limited to, the areas of border security, government benefits and taxes,” he said."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"The House speaker, John A.

2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"A vote to allow a debate is no guarantee of a bill’s passage: the Senate cleared that threshold on legislation to tighten the nation’s gun laws, but its key provision, to tighten background checks on gun buyers, still went down to defeat."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"At the same time, this procedural vote was larger than one in 2007, when the Senate last debated immigration reform, and Mr. Obama was clearly determined to seize the moment."

2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"“He’s got to strike the right tone and the right balance of using the office effectively and not trampling on the process that’s currently under way.” A senior White House official said Mr. Obama’s involvement was important because the bill’s success would hinge on winning the support of Hispanic voters, and “there is no Republican with the credibility to sell this to that community — only the president can.” On Tuesday, though, senators seemed more immersed in their own debate than in reacting to Mr. Obama."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"“Well, he doesn’t vote in the Senate anymore, so right now we’re just focused on getting it passed in the Senate in a responsible way,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who was one of the architects of the bill and is one of his party’s most prominent Hispanics."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the Democrats “promised immigration reform in 2009, they didn’t deliver, so they need to step up to the plate there.” Another member of the so-called Gang of Eight behind the bill, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said Mr. Obama’s remarks echoed the principles in the legislation, but added of Republicans, “Some of them have Obamaphobia, so no matter what he does, they won’t be happy.” Mr. Boehner said he expected that the “House bill will be to the right of where the Senate is,” but he would not say whether he expected any legislation that came out of the House to include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"Mr. Obama, in an attempt to allay fears about immigration changes, said the bill before the Senate included the tightest border control provisions in American history."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"He said twice that illegal crossings were “near their lowest levels in decades.” But the president also insisted on a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally — a provision that has continued to be a sticking point between the senators who drafted the legislation and conservative Republicans, especially in the House, who believe that approach represents amnesty for those who broke the law to enter or stay in the country."
2253,0,Obama Presses Immigration Bill as Senate Opens Debate,"The process, he said, would be long and arduous, requiring people to pay taxes as well as a penalty, learn English, and then go to the back of the line behind applicants for American citizenship who entered the country lawfully."

2255,0,Senate Digs In for Long Battle on Overhaul of Immigration,It is largely in step with the president’s goals of offering a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the country while tightening border security and expanding legal entry into the country for families and workers.

2256,0,Obama Calls Surveillance Programs Legal and Limited,But the disclosure hours later of secret contingency planning to target other countries for possible cyberattacks made his get-together with President Xi Jinping later in the day all the more awkward because cyberattacks by the Chinese are high on the American agenda.
2256,0,Obama Calls Surveillance Programs Legal and Limited,The latest of three documents published over three days by the British newspaper The Guardian added to the understanding of the Obama administration’s approach to national security in an age of multifaceted threats and became another factor in the renewed debate over the balance between privacy and security.

2256,0,Obama Calls Surveillance Programs Legal and Limited,"The directive ordered the government to “identify potential targets of national importance” against which offensive cyberoperations “can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power.” That means, in essence, that the Pentagon’s Cyber Command and the intelligence agencies would maintain lists of targets around the world that could be damaged more effectively, and more covertly, by a computer attack than by a missile or bomber attack."

2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,The president they serve has steadfastly resisted intervening in the most dire human-rights calamity he has faced since taking office: the civil war in Syria.
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"Given Mr. Obama’s well-known skepticism about the dangers of more direct involvement, it is not clear whether Ms. Rice and Ms. Power can — or even want to — change his mind about more aggressive action."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"But there is little doubt that along with two other recent additions to his national security team, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, they will bring a different tone to foreign policy in Mr. Obama’s second term."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"At the same time, the resignation of Tom Donilon as national security adviser, which precipitated Wednesday’s announcement, could create complications for a White House that takes pride in a smooth-running operation that Mr. Donilon has overseen for more than two and a half years."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"Ms. Rice, who is taking Mr. Donilon’s job, and Ms. Power, who is replacing Ms. Rice as ambassador to the United Nations, joined forces in 2011, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, to persuade Mr. Obama to back a NATO-led intervention in Libya."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"Yet neither Ms. Rice, 48, nor Ms. Power, 42, has spoken out in favor of a more aggressive response in Syria, attesting to both the insoluble nature of the conflict and the discipline of the White House."

2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"“I don’t need the glory; I want to get stuff done.” But Ms. Rice’s ascendancy could be a headache for Mr. Kerry, whose path to the State Department opened up after the furor over her role in explaining the deadly attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, forced her to withdraw her name from consideration for the department’s top job."

2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"For Ms. Rice, who began her career in the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, Rwanda was a crucible."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"President Bill Clinton’s inaction in the face of genocide there led people who worked for him, including Ms. Rice, to vow never again to allow such a slaughter."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"Years later, she told Ms. Power, who was then a journalist writing about the episode, that “I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come down on the side of dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required.” However fervent these new officials are, some former officials say they may not make a big difference."

2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,Colleagues of Mr. Donilon said his most lasting policy legacy would be the administration’s shift in priorities from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the fast-growing economies of Asia.
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"“What Tom provided was the air cover that allowed for a very substantial shift in focus from the Middle East and South Asia toward Asia proper,” said Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"While Asia has not been a focus for either Ms. Rice or Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rhodes said that was not necessary because the policy had been set."
2259,0,ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choices Reflect Change in Foreign Tone,"Likewise, he said, Ms. Rice did not need to devote as much of her time to the bureaucratic aspects of the job as Mr. Donilon did because the system he created would live on after his departure."

2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama on Friday stepped into the hyper-partisan fight over student debt, warning about the economic dangers posed by rising debt burdens and urging Congress to pass legislation to prevent interest rates on some loans from doubling as a hard deadline looms on July 1."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"His speech comes against a backdrop of rising tuition, increasing debt burdens, record relative interest rates on federal student loans and growing worries that student debt -- once seen as a ticket to a college degree and a well-paying job -- may be restraining the U.S. economy as debt-laden graduates curtail consumption."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"The average new college graduate carries more than $26,000 in student debt, Obama said, flanked by college students at the White House."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,“That doesn’t just hold back our young graduates.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"It holds back our entire middle class,” he said."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Student loan payments “can last for years, even decades, which means young people are putting off buying their first car or their first house -- the things that grow our economy and create new jobs,” Obama added."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"If Congress and the White House fail to agree, interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans for undergraduate students are set to double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent on July 1 because of the expiration of a 2007 law that had gradually lowered the rate."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,The hike would affect about one quarter of new federal student loan dollars.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"The doubled rates would cost affected borrowers, who come from middle- and lower-income households, about $1,000 more over the average 12-year life of each loan."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,House Republicans are pushing a bill that would tie interest rates on all federal student loans to the U.S. government’s cost to borrow for 10 years.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"The White House has put forward a similar proposal, but it would freeze the rate for the life of the loan."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Assuming interest rates do not spike, the administration's plan likely would be cheaper for students."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"The Republicans’ plan, however, caps interest rates."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"The Republican bill “fails to lock in low rates for students next year,"" Obama said."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""That's not smart."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,It eliminates safeguards for lower-income families.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,That's not fair.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"It could actually cost a freshman starting school next fall more over four years than if we did nothing at all.” If the stakes sound familiar, it's because the Washington gridlock, intensified by election-year politics last year, resulted in a short-term fix when the interest rate was supposed to double last July."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Obama made a similar push then, launching a campaign called ""Don't Double My Rate,"" though he delivered the message primarily on college campuses in battleground states Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina, as well as on Jimmy Fallon's late night talk show."

2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Last year, furious Republicans on Capitol Hill accused the president of pandering to the youth to recapture a vote that helped propel him to the White House in 2008."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,It wasn't until GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney endorsed an extension of the lower rate that Republican lawmakers relented.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,Congress kept the rate at 3.4 percent for one year.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"To keep the decrease in interest income from affecting the government’s annual budget deficit, interest rates on federal loans for graduate students rose."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"While the battle ultimately ended with an extension of the lower rates, some advocates worry that outcome will be harder to achieve this time around -- perhaps because of partisan rancor."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""Last year, the issue became a political football and student aid got politicized,"" said Chris Lindstrom, a higher education advocate with Public Interest Research Group."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""The issue had previously enjoyed bipartisan support and last year it became very partisan and we continue to have that divide."""
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""Quite a few factors make it harder for us to win the low rate extension this year,"" Lindstrom added."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""Nonetheless, we need to try."""
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Other student loan experts reckon that the impending reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the law that governs federal aid to higher education, and a flood of proposals on Capitol Hill may improve prospects for a bipartisan compromise."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"For example, many proposed bills in Congress call for the government to tie student borrowing costs to the federal government’s, rather than the current system of arbitrarily set interest rates."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"If lawmakers eventually strike a deal to lower students’ cost to borrow from the federal government, they would have to either allow the compromise to increase budget deficits or reduce spending on other programs."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"This year, the Obama administration is set to record nearly $51 billion in profit off student borrowers, according to the Congressional Budget Office."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"The government profits by borrowing at near-record low rates and then charging students interest rates last set by Congress in 2007, when borrowing costs across the economy were much higher."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Obama's speech likely will kick off a new wave of advocacy, as students are expected to march on Capitol Hill to make their case next week."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"It is already drawing criticism from Republicans, who preemptively lashed out at the White House for what they believe is an effort to point fingers at them rather than look for ways to compromise."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"Even as Obama spoke, staffers for GOP leadership took to Twitter to imply the event was merely an effort to distract from recent scandals facing the administration."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.)
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,made a similar point during an appearance on MSNBC Friday morning.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""It’s not only a distraction from issues like Benghazi and the IRS and Department of Justice, but it’s a distraction from the fact that the real threat to college-age students in America today is not a few more dollars on their student loan, it’s the fact that the explosive growth of debt, the fact that the jobs in this economy for young people entering the marketplace have been the people probably most hurt by the Obama policies,"" he said."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""It’s time for the president to stop politicizing the student loan issue,"" Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.), who chairs the House education committee, said in a statement shortly after Obama finished speaking."
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"""The president and House Republicans agree on the need for a long-term, market-based plan that will take politicians out of the business of arbitrarily setting student loan interest rates."""
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) piled on, calling the speech ""misguided and deeply disappointing."""
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,Republicans have also picked up one of Obama's tricks as they prep for the fight.
2269,0,Obama Poses Student Loan Challenge To Republicans,"GOP leadership debuted the hashtag #YouDeserveBetter on Friday, though time will tell if they can beat the president at his own game."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"As I mentioned he would be earlier this week, President Obama dedicated his Friday morning to educating the youths he used as backdrops at the White House about why it is that the GOP’s idea to fix this cyclical federal student-loan battle by tying interest rates to the market, instead of the president’s own plan allowing politicians to continue to arbitrarily determine the interest rates that they deem appropriate, is such a very terrible take on the problem."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,It went pretty much exactly as you’d expect.
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,Key words: “Fair.” “Investments.” “Not the time for us to turn our back on young people.” Ugh.
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"Let us overlook for a moment the fact that the president is perpetuating a student-loan bubble via a broken system that floods that market with too much demand that in turn causes college prices to just keep right on rising, and focus instead on the fact that the differences between the president’s and the GOP’s plans will have a negligible impact on actual student-loan payments."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"This is just politics as usual, via the WSJ: House Education Chairman John Kline’s bill sets floating rates on new Stafford loans at the 10-year Treasury rate plus 2.5%, while also protecting borrowers by capping the rates at 8.5%."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"Under this plan, a borrower can consolidate his loans after graduation to achieve a fixed rate."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"Mr. Obama’s plan is purely for fixed, not floating, rates at the 10-year Treasury rate plus 0.93% or 2.93% depending on the type of Stafford loan, and it has no rate cap."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"We wish both the House and Mr. Obama would drive a harder bargain on behalf of the taxpayer, but they aren’t separated by a difference of philosophy."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"A spread of 93 or 293 basis points means the President cares about young people, but 250 basis points signifies unspeakable cruelty?"
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"… Under either plan, rates for new Stafford loans for undergraduates will not nearly rise all the way to 6.8% from 3.4%, as they are scheduled to do on July 1."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"But the White House likes to run against a doubling of rates even when, as in this case, they are running unopposed."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"It has been a good political issue for Team Obama in the past, and there’s another reason they may regard it as favorable ground to attack imaginary adversaries."
2269,1,Obama on student loan rates: like deja-vu all over again,"Hey, if President Obama really wants to focus in on helping young people with life after college, maybe we could worry a little less about piddling, stimulus-esque, big-government market interferences and a little more on our sluggish economy and 16 percent youth unemployment rate?"

2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., a lightning rod of Republican attacks during President Obama’s first term, is now contending with a new round of criticism over the Justice Department’s campaign against leaks to the news media."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"This time it is the news media and even some Democrats who are upset with Mr. Holder, who in recent days has taken steps seemingly aimed at assuaging them."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,He endorsed the enactment of a “media shield” law and invited leaders of news organizations to meet with him Thursday to discuss tightening rules on warrants and subpoenas for reporters’ records as part of leak investigations.
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"Even as Mr. Holder has sought to regain his footing, Republicans have resumed their criticism, accusing him of misleading Congress in testimony over whether the Justice Department has considered prosecuting journalists under the Espionage Act for publishing government secrets."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"In a letter Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, and a Republican colleague, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, expressed “great concern” about Mr. Holder’s testimony before the committee this month, saying it “appeared to be at odds” with court documents that have come to light involving a warrant for e-mails of James Rosen, a Fox News reporter."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"The prospect of a new round of perjury accusations from Congress has underscored that the furor over the leak investigations might pose a new threat to Mr. Holder, who surprised many Democrats by choosing to stay on after Mr. Obama’s re-election."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"For now, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are standing by Mr. Holder, even though the ranking member, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, pronounced himself “deeply troubled” by some of the investigative tactics used in recent leak cases."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"“Certainly, it is fair to ask additional questions about the Rosen investigation, and any role the attorney general may have played in it, but I do not believe it credible to level charges that he may have intentionally misled the committee on this matter before we know the facts of the case in question,” Mr. Conyers said."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"In his only recent interview, Mr. Holder told The Daily Beast that the investigations obeyed existing laws and guidelines, but he also said the rules “need to be updated.” He called the furor “an opportunity for the department to consider how we strike the right balance between the interests of law enforcement and freedom of the press.” The Daily Beast article also paraphrased unnamed aides as saying Mr. Holder was “also beginning to feel a creeping sense of personal remorse.” Reid Weingarten, a lawyer who has been a friend of Mr. Holder’s for three decades, said Mr. Holder had discussed no such feelings with him."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"Rather, Mr. Weingarten said, the disclosure to Fox News of the existence of a rare intelligence source in North Korea was “a horrible leak and he was charged with the responsibility to get at it.” That raised what he said Mr. Holder described to him as a trade-off between press freedoms and the need to identify leakers — a problem for which there are no easy answers because it pits “two laudable goals” against each other."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"“He’s not immune from the criticism, but I think he sees this First Amendment-security conflict as almost impossibly difficult,” Mr. Weingarten said, adding: “He hasn’t confessed or cried to me, that’s for sure."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,What I sense in conversations with him is how horribly difficult the dilemma is when you have this situation.
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"It’s important to get it right, and if we didn’t get it right — and that’s a big if — let’s button up the process now.” Matthew Miller, a friend and former top aide to Mr. Holder, portrayed the attorney general’s proposal to tighten laws and guidelines on when news media records may be obtained as coming out of a realization that one cannot expect law enforcement officials to do anything less than what the rules permit when pursuing a particular case."
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"Meanwhile, Mr. Holder has invited representatives from several major news organizations to discuss whether and how the Justice Department’s regulations for leak investigations should be modified."

2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,An affidavit says there was probable cause to believe Mr. Rosen had violated the Espionage Act.
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,Mr. Holder approved the warrant.
2272,0,Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries,"Law enforcement officials said the affidavit included that language to invoke an exception to a law that otherwise bars search warrants for reporters’ work product, and noted that while the analyst accused of leaking, Stephen Kim, was indicted in August 2010, Mr. Rosen was not charged."

2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It","Let's begin with a verbatim quote from President Obama from July of 2009, touting the legislative perfection that would be Obamacare: “If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor."

2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It",No matter what.” Many people who buy their own health insurance could get surprises in the mail this fall: cancellation notices because their current policies aren't up to the basic standards of President Barack Obama's health care law.
2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It","They, and some small businesses, will have to find replacement plans — and that has some state insurance officials worried about consumer confusion."
2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It","Also, it doesn't seem to square with one of the president's best known promises about his health care overhaul: ""If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan."""
2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It",...
2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It","The Obama administration did not respond directly to questions about the potential fallout from cancellation notices ... For the most part, state insurance commissioners are giving insurers the option of canceling existing plans or changing them to comply with new federal requirements."
2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It",A document circulated to House Democrats by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi — and obtained by BuzzFeed — offers some details of the timing of the health-care plan: Rates and details of plans will become public in September for the 34 states that haven’t put together their own plans.
2273,1,"Obamacare Reminder: Even If You Like Your Plan, You Can't Necessarily Keep It","The goals, Pelosi writes in a “dear colleague” letter that begins the document, are “to educate our constituents about the new law, help to implement it, and strengthen the hands of those who have worked for this historic reform.”"
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"The Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare, goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year, and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"There will be an administrative “train wreck,” we’re told; consumers will face a terrible shock."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Republicans, one hears, are already counting on the law’s troubles to give them a big electoral advantage."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"No doubt there will be problems, as there are with any large new government initiative, and in this case, we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Yet important new evidence — especially from California, the law’s most important test case — suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Before I can explain what the news means, I need to make a crucial point: Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform, not in a political sense (although it was originally a Republican proposal) but in terms of leaving most people’s health care unaffected."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Americans who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicare or Medicaid — which is to say, the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all — will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"There are, however, millions of Americans who don’t receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"They can get insurance only by buying it on their own, and many of them are effectively shut out of that market."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"In some states, like California, insurers reject applicants with past medical problems."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"In others, like New York, insurers can’t reject applicants, and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history (“community rating”); unfortunately, this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up, while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach.
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"First, community rating everywhere — no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Second, the “mandate” — you must buy insurance even if you’re currently healthy."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Third, subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Massachusetts has had essentially this system since 2006; as a result, nearly all residents have health insurance, and the program remains very popular."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"So we know that Obamacare — or, as some of us call it, ObamaRomneyCare — can work."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Skeptics argued, however, that Massachusetts was special: it had relatively few uninsured residents even before the reform, and it already had community rating."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,What would happen elsewhere?
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"In particular, what would happen in California, where more than a fifth of the nonelderly population is uninsured, and the individual insurance market is largely unregulated?"
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,Would there be “sticker shock” as the price of individual policies soared?
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Well, the California bids are in — that is, insurers have submitted the prices at which they are willing to offer coverage on the state’s newly created Obamacare exchange."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"And the prices, it turns out, are surprisingly low."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"A handful of healthy people may find themselves paying more for coverage, but it looks as if Obamacare’s first year in California is going to be an overwhelmingly positive experience."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,What can still go wrong?
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Well, Obamacare is a complicated program, basically because simpler options, like Medicare for all, weren’t considered politically feasible."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"So there will probably be a lot of administrative confusion as the law goes into effect, again especially in states where Republicans have been doing their best to sabotage the process."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Also, some people are too poor to afford coverage even with the subsidies."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"These Americans were supposed to be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid, but in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion, such unfortunates will be left out in the cold."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"Still, here’s what it seems is about to happen: millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage, and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all.
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it, the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious."
2273,0,The Obamacare Shock,"So yes, it does look as if there’s an Obamacare shock coming: the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can, strange to say, end up helping a lot of people — especially when government officials actually try to make it work."

2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"WASHINGTON — Senior Treasury officials were made aware in June 2012 that investigators were looking into complaints from tea party groups that they were being harassed by the Internal Revenue Service, a Treasury inspector general said Friday, disclosing that Obama administration officials knew there was a probe during the heat of the presidential campaign."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, testified alongside ousted IRS head Steven Miller, who did little to subdue Republican outrage during hours of intense congressional questioning."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"Both defiant and apologetic, Miller acknowledged agency mistakes in targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status, but he insisted that agents broke no laws and that there was no effort to cover up their actions."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"Miller only stoked the criticism of many Republicans, who are assailing the administration on a sudden spate of other controversies, as well, even as some Democrats tried to contain the political damage."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"SEE ALSO: Facing fire, ousted IRS chief apologizes for tea party targeting “I don’t know that I got any answers from you today,” Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., told Miller."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"“I am more concerned today than I was before.” At one point in the day’s hearing, Treasury IG George said he had told the department’s general counsel about his investigation on June 4, 2012, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin “shortly thereafter.” But, George cautioned, those discussions were “not to inform them of the results of the audit."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"It was to inform them of the fact that we were conducting the audit.” After the hearing, inspector general spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar said George “informed Department of Treasury officials that we were looking into the IRS‘ handling of applications for tax-exempt status, partly due to allegations raised by conservative organizations.” Kraushaar said the disclosure was part of a routine briefing about the office’s activities."
2293,1,Treasury officials told of IRS probe in June 2012,"The Treasury Department issued a statement Friday saying officials first became aware of the actual results of the investigation in March of this year, when they were provided a draft of George’s report, a standard practice."

2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Thursday intensified their criticism of the Obama administration for its handling of the assault on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, with Speaker John A. Boehner calling for the release of an e-mail that he said showed that State Department officials believed from the start that “Islamic terrorists” were linked to the attack but have declined to say so publicly."
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"Mr. Boehner’s demand, delivered the day after a dramatic hearing by a House committee, signaled that Republican leaders intend to continue portraying the attack as a major failure by the administration as well as a potentially effective issue against former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton if she runs for president in 2016."
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"“The State Department would not allow our committees to keep copies of this e-mail when it was reviewed,” Mr. Boehner said."
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"“I would call on the president to order the State Department to release this e-mail so that the American people can see it.” During Wednesday’s hearing, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, read an excerpt from the e-mail, quoting what he said was a reference to the local militant group that carried out the attack, Ansar al-Shariah, as having links to “Islamic terrorists.” But a copy of the e-mail reviewed by The New York Times indicates that A. Elizabeth Jones, the senior State Department official who wrote it, referred to “Islamic extremists,” not terrorists."
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"The distinction is important, administration officials said, because while the White House did not initially characterize the attack as terrorism, senior officials, including Ambassador Susan E. Rice, acknowledged the possibility that extremists had been involved in the assault."
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"Mr. Gowdy and other Republicans dismissed that as a distinction without a difference, saying that the e-mail’s significance was in its timing — the day after the attack — and in its blunt description of what happened."
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"“The group that conducted the attacks — Ansar al-Shariah — is affiliated with Islamic extremists,” Ms. Jones, an acting assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, wrote in the e-mail, which was distributed to nine senior State Department officials, though not to Mrs. Clinton directly."

2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,It flared up anew on Wednesday after three State Department officials testified that they faced intimidation and punishment after questioning how the episode was handled.
2309,0,Benghazi Debate Focuses on Interpretation of Early E-Mail on Attackers,"“Four Americans lost their lives in this terrorist attack,” Mr. Boehner said, “and Congress is going to continue to investigate this issue using all the resources at our disposal.” For months, House Republicans have been pressing Mr. Boehner to take a more public stand on the matter, because it fires up the Republican base as lawmakers head into the midterm election cycle."

2324,0,Obama Nominates Pritzker for Commerce Post,"“Every nominee’s offshore tax avoidance activities should be examined as part of the nomination process,” he said, suggesting that Ms. Pritzker is “associated with the kind of tax avoidance activity that the president dismisses as fat cat shenanigans for others.” Ms. Pritzker, a longtime Chicago donor and fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, had been expected to be his pick for the long-vacant Commerce Department post, but vetting of her substantial financial assets and ties delayed a formal announcement, administration aides have said."

2324,0,Obama Nominates Pritzker for Commerce Post,"Even so, the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O’Neill, issued a statement immediately after the announcement saying that “the numbers are good, but not great,” since women are 51 percent of the population but about one-third of the cabinet."

2324,0,Obama Nominates Pritzker for Commerce Post,"Although the post was not a cabinet position, Mr. Froman had proximity to the president and a portfolio thicker than that of the cabinet-rank trade representative, encompassing not only trade but also international development and climate change issues."
2324,0,Obama Nominates Pritzker for Commerce Post,"Mr. Froman had planned to keep his White House post in the second term, and Mr. Obama initially intended to nominate Jeffrey D. Zients, a businessman who had been the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, to be trade representative."
2324,0,Obama Nominates Pritzker for Commerce Post,"But opposition to Mr. Zients from Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which would handle his nomination, scuttled it."

2324,0,Obama Nominates Pritzker for Commerce Post,"“He has also won a reputation as being an extraordinarily tough negotiator while doing it.” Labor groups generally have had good if occasionally testy relations with Mr. Froman, but a liberal group, Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, assailed his “corporate agenda.” Business groups issued statements praising him and Ms. Pritzker."

2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"But he might as well have, as this week's furloughs of air traffic controllers make obvious."
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"The furloughs reflect panic: Having exaggerated their early predictions that the sequester's small reduction in spending growth would seriously affect Americans, many Democrats are hell-bent to pre-empt those Americans from drawing two logical conclusions: If one level of cuts is this painless, then maybe we should make ... more cuts to expenditures."
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"And while we're at it, maybe we should ignore the politicians who told us that if Washington lowered the spending growth curve ... the Earth will fly into the sun...."
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"So, what could the administration do to make a reduction of barely 1 percent of actual federal outlays — less than $45 billion of this year's roughly $3.8 trillion — turn citizens against Republicans who oppose more tax increases?"
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"Easy, or so the president's men and women figured: Cue the air controller furloughs!"

2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,— stupid enough to think that the Federal Aviation Administration can't find a more flier-friendly way to save $600 million.
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"The Trib's editors also cite polling showing that the public is less and less worried about the sequester cuts by the day, which likely sparked panic inside the White House:  We can't allow spending cuts to go unnoticed."

2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,UPDATE II (Katie) - The House has passed legislation halting furloughs of FAA controllers.
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,A bill that would end the Federal Aviation Administration’s furlough on air traffic controllers is now on its way to President Obama to sign.
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"On Friday, the House passed the measure 361-41."
2331,1,White House in Full Retreat as FAA Sequester Stunt Backfires,"On Thursday night, the Senate passed the legislation after most lawmakers had left the Capitol for a weeklong vacation."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"WASHINGTON — President Obama and Congressional Democrats on Friday abandoned their once-firm stand that growing airport bottlenecks would be addressed only in a broader fix to across-the-board spending cuts, accepting bipartisan legislation that would bring the nation’s air traffic control system back up to full strength."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"With remarkable speed, the House overwhelmingly approved legislation to give the secretary of transportation enough financial flexibility to shift as much as $253 million to the air traffic control system, less than a week after the onset of politically problematic flight delays driven by across-the-board spending cuts."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"The money will be shifted from airport improvement funds, and none would come from additional revenues, once a key demand of Mr. Obama and the Democrats."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,The 361-to-41 vote came less than 24 hours after the Senate rushed the measure through.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,Republicans claimed victory.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"“Consider that the Democrats’ opening position was they would only replace the sequester with tax increases,” Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in a memo to members before the vote."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"“By last night, Senate Democrats were adopting our targeted ‘cut this, not that’ approach."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"This victory is in large part a result of our standing together.” The Congressional action effectively undoes one of the thorniest results of “sequestration,” the $85 billion in spending cuts that took effect March 1 and have rippled across the federal government."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"With the president’s promised signature, Democrats will lose significant leverage they had hoped would force Republicans into a larger agreement since the flight delays were seen as the sort of inconvenience that could force a reversal of the cuts."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,The action also brought charges that lawmakers known for gridlock could move only when affluent travelers like themselves felt the sting of Congress’s indecision and that the struggles of lower-income Americans affected by the spending cuts were being ignored.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"House members who have cleared precious little legislation this year made swift work of the air travel bill minutes before flying out themselves for a weeklong break, a pile of cars stacked up behind the Capitol waiting to ferry them to Washington’s airports."

2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"That’s basically what’s happening.” The shifting of $253 million from the airport improvement program to air traffic operations in the Federal Aviation Administration should be enough to stop further furloughs and keep the air traffic control system operating at a normal pace through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"“This is a Band-Aid solution,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, even as he said Mr. Obama would sign it."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,“It does not solve the bigger problem.” Republicans — and some Democrats — had been pushing for much of the month for a rescue of the air traffic control system.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,But lawmakers who wanted a separate budget rescue for the F.A.A.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"met resistance from some lawmakers who questioned why air travel was being rescued when children were being thrown out of early education programs, food safety inspections were being curtailed and checks to the long-term unemployed were shrinking."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"With those cuts largely invisible to most Americans, some Democrats argued that mounting delays at airports might be the only pressure point left to force Republicans to negotiate a broader deal to reverse the cuts, with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"That position held sway with Democrats into Thursday evening, when Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, cornered Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,“We made the pitch that this wasn’t about elite Americans.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"This is about all Americans,” Mr. Udall said, singling out hotel and restaurant workers, airport workers and others who would be affected by a sharp decline in air travel."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,Opponents also feared that a rifle-shot rescue of the air traffic-control system would open the floodgates for other supplicants seeking relief from the cuts.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,That fear was realized almost the moment the bill cleared Congress.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"Cancer clinics, Head Start administrators, housing advocates and teachers all demanded that their programs be addressed next."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"“We’ve seen how devastating the cuts to our core government programs are already, from cuts in Head Start, reductions in housing assistance, cuts to unemployment benefits and fewer job training programs — all when our nation still has a 7.7 percent unemployment rate,” said Rachel Gragg, federal policy director for the National Skills Coalition, a job training advocacy group."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"“And yet, Congress is scrambling to fix one small — if highly visible — piece of sequestration, rather than solve the whole problem.” But visible it was."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"On United Airlines Flight 1543 from San Francisco to Washington on Friday, the pilot announced after a 90-minute delay that Congress was at fault for “their ineptitude,” having financed “worthless projects” but not the F.A.A."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"A consulting company called masFlight said Friday that since furloughs began on Sunday, the percentage of flights from major American airports that waited more than an hour to take off rose to 1.4 percent from 0.7 percent, and the percentage that waited from 31 to 60 minutes increased to 9.5 percent from 7.2 percent, compared with the previous month."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,Republicans continued to assert that those delays were intentionally inflicted on the traveling public by a White House eager to press its political point.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"“We’re here today because this administration has decided to put politics over passengers,” said Representative Rodney Davis, a freshman Republican from Illinois, who said the administration already had the flexibility to save the air traffic controllers."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,But even Republican aides said that was not true.
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"Under sequestration rules, all program categories faced cuts, and backfilling the narrow category “air traffic operations” at the Transportation Department took Congressional action."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"With Democrats now in retreat, further program-specific actions could be possible."
2331,0,House Joins Senate in Passing Bill to Ease Flight Delays,"When Congress passed legislation financing the government through Sept. 30, it granted some select agencies the flexibility to make such changes."

2332,1,Boston Marathon bombing suspect moved to federal medical center,"Kelly called the New York plot ""spontaneous,"" and said they had six bombs with them in the car, some of which they hurled at police cars hours later when they were being pursued in a chase that culminated in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's death."

2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"The homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, testified on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Senate’s bipartisan immigration bill."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"For hours, in a calm and methodical manner, she flipped each confrontational line of questioning on its head."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"No, the bill would not loosen security at borders and ports."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,It would tighten it.
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"The bill would not weaken immigration enforcement, but strengthen it — adding resources and improving the government’s ability to keep unwanted people out and to catch fugitives, identify thieves and terrorists."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"Ms. Napolitano’s testimony filled the last of three days of hearings on the immigration bill, a marathon featuring more than two dozen witnesses from all corners of the country — sort of an immigration Woodstock."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"Within those three days and the bill’s 844 pages lay a dizzying blizzard of details, but after Ms. Napolitano wrapped things up, a clearer picture started to emerge."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"A veteran of the immigration battles could have watched her speak and still have been amazed at the vast sums of money and resources that have been sent to militarize America’s southern border, as if the people flowing across it were an existential threat rather than a problem and opportunity to be controlled and redirected."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"Ms. Napolitano’s testimony evoked a world of drones, radar and motion sensors, Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops, fencing and razor wire stretching for miles and miles."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"The bill calls for up to $6.5 billion in new spending, with expanded workplace-verification and entry-exit visa systems, and still more boots and fencing."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"What was especially striking was how much of this enforcement has already been accomplished, even as the country keeps waiting for the broader, once-in-a-generation immigration overhaul that this bill — and a companion bill being written in the House — is trying to achieve."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,The bill was only just filed and may not pass.
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,The opponents of reform are intense in their desire to break it apart or stall it until it dies.
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"Their arguments against the bill itself are unpersuasive — who could oppose making the system fairer and more efficient, clearing backlogs in legal immigration, or creating a more rational and streamlined visa process to supply the economy with the labor it needs, from Silicon Valley to dairy farms to citrus groves?"
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"What they do have is fear and anxiety, intensified by the Boston bombings."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"One witness on Monday, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and an outsize figure in the nation’s anti-immigration battles, argued at length about how the bill might allow a hypothetical terrorist calling himself “Rumpelstiltskin” to get his papers and travel as freely as the Boston suspects did."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"As Senator Charles Schumer of New York correctly noted, the bill’s opposition grows from one root: restrictionist organizations that see no good in immigration short of mass deportation."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"They have profited immensely from fear, as the bristling southern border attests."
2333,0,On Beyond Fear,"But the flip side of fear is hope, exemplified by the host of witnesses on the other side — the growers, business owners, ministers, state officials, human-rights advocates and undocumented people themselves who have the better argument."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,DALLAS — President Obama has left little mystery about how he views his predecessor.
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,“The failed policies of George W. Bush” wiped away a budget surplus and “squandered the legacy” of bipartisan foreign policy.
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"Mr. Bush put two wars “on a credit card,” led the country away “from our values” and “crashed the economy.” But Mr. Obama will surely say none of that when he helps dedicate the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on Thursday."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"Addressing a crowd of Bush supporters and administration veterans, the 44th president will no doubt extol the virtues of the 43rd and praise his years of service to the country."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,It has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one.
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world’s most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"The task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"“When a president dedicates the library of someone he opposed politically, it’s interesting and a bit of a challenge,” said Michael Waldman, who was the chief speechwriter for President Bill Clinton when he helped President George Bush open his library in 1997."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"“The best thing to do is focus on something that you can really embrace and mean it.” Kenneth Khachigian, a chief speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said there was a formula: “If you’re a speechwriter, you can write a really nice speech about how Americans can fight and disagree and debate, but at the end of the day we’re all Americans and we have the same goals, and I’ve learned that anybody who sits in this office really at the end of the day has the best interest of everyone at heart.” That is a fair summation of what Reagan said in dedicating President Jimmy Carter’s library in October 1986."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"In that case, the dedication came in the midst of a midterm election campaign, so the moment of conciliation was followed just weeks later by fairly tough language on the campaign trail in which Reagan criticized Mr. Carter’s policies."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"With no election at hand, Mr. Obama has more latitude, not having to worry about alienating his base, which still loathes Mr. Bush."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,A gracious speech could also fit into his outreach to Congressional Republicans.
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,The timing of the legislative calendar does give him some fodder for common ground with Mr. Bush.
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"As he fights to liberalize the immigration system, Mr. Obama could use the speech to point out that he and Mr. Bush agree on the issue, implicitly pressuring other Republicans to join them."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,That is not to say that Mr. Obama is putting away his partisan hat altogether.
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"He flew to Dallas on Wednesday, a day early, to appear at a Democratic fund-raiser."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"At the ceremony on Thursday at the new Bush center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University, he will be joined by the elder Mr. Bush, Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"At the event on Wednesday, Mr. Obama told donors: “I’m really looking forward to attending the Bush library opening tomorrow."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"One of the things I will insist upon is whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves its people and shares that same concern, and was concerned about all people in America, not just those who voted Republican.” But Mr. Bush’s circle is anticipating the encounter with a certain suspicion."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"While the former president retreated to Texas after leaving office and has refrained from criticizing his successor, Mr. Obama made Mr. Bush a foil on the campaign trail, attributing the country’s problems to the situation he inherited."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"“A huge part of his messaging platform for his presidency has been the contrast, laying it off on his predecessor,” said Dan Bartlett, who was the White House counselor under Mr. Bush."
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"“He’s going to have to thread the needle.” Mr. Bush’s advisers bristled at Mr. Obama’s Inaugural Address in 2009, when the new president criticized “our collective failure to make hard choices” and assured the world “that we are ready to lead once more.” They also thought that Mr. Obama was grudging when he unveiled Mr. Bush’s portrait at the White House in 2012."

2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"Marc Thiessen, a chief speechwriter in the Bush White House, said the test on Thursday would be whether Mr. Obama could be “substantively generous,” not just “personally generous.” In other words, would Mr. Obama acknowledge that despite their differences over Iraq, health care and other issues, Mr. Bush accomplished worthy things in office, like his fight against AIDS in Africa?"
2334,0,Obama's Delicate Task at Bush Library Event,"“He’s never going to say this,” Mr. Thiessen said, “but if he’s being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.” Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush have more in common than either might admit."

2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"So I take this occasion to remind my fellow liberal Democrats, many of whom continue to attack Bush in harsh and personal terms, of three things about him that I don’t think they understand or appreciate."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"First, while there were many polices under Bush with which liberal Democrats (myself included) disagreed — such as tax cuts, the Iraq War and not paying for either (as well as the Afghan war) with current revenues rather than borrowed money — there must be a distinction between disagreement and personal attack."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"[pullquote] For example, many Democrats still use the “lie” word in describing Bush’s rationale for the Iraq War — that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"This turned out to be wrong.But Democrats in the Clinton administration also believed Saddam had WMDs, as did most experts in the U.S. intelligence community."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,Our politics have become so poisoned and our government so dysfunctional precisely because too many people — on both sides — can’t make a distinction between lies and being sincerely wrong.
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"Second, Bush is known for his brilliant slogan when he first ran in 2000, describing himself as a “compassionate conservative.” But let’s not forget that on many issues, Bush was more “compassionate” than “conservative” — indeed, he was sometimes closer to Republican Theodore Roosevelt’s free-market progressivism than William Howard Taft’s laissez-faire conservatism."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"Examples include “No Child Left Behind” education reform, presented together at the White House by Bush and the liberal icon Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)"

2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"I recall an evening when a group of us was sitting in the common room outside the college dining hall after dinner and a fellow Yale student walked by who was known to be gay, but in those days was not “out.” Someone said some ugly homophobic slurs."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"I didn’t like it, yet sat silently."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"But Bush snapped, saying something like “Hey, knock it off."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"Why don’t you walk in his shoes awhile and feel what he feels?” I remember thinking, “Whoa."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"This guy is much different inside than the fun-loving frat brother partying with me at Delta Kappa Epsilon.” As I watched him grow and evolve over the years, overcoming times of great personal pain and challenge to become a two-time governor of Texas and a two-term president of the United States, I only came to admire and like him even more than that evening at Yale."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"My late mother always used to say you can judge people on how they love and treat animals — good if they do, bad if they don’t."
2335,1,Democrat reveals 3 things liberals don't get about George W. Bush,"When Bush’s beloved dog, Barney, died recently, the statement he issued exemplified for me the inner core of goodness on my mother’s scale of judgment."

2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"“I think we need more police and more surveillance in the communities where the threat is coming from,” he told National Review."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"“The new threat is definitely from within.” Mr. King’s hypothesis, and the widespread surveillance policies already in effect since 9/11, assume that the threat of radicalization has become a matter of local geography, that American Muslims are creating extremists in our mosques and community centers."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"But what we’re learning of the suspects, the brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, suggests a different story, and one that has itself become familiar: radicalization does not happen to young people with a strong grounding in the American Muslim mainstream; increasingly, it happens online, and sometimes abroad, among the isolated and disaffected."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"The YouTube page of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, for example, does not contain a single lecture from a scholar, imam or institution in America."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"One report suggests that he found the theology taught in a local Cambridge mosque, the Islamic Society of Boston, unpalatable: while attending a Friday service in which an imam praised the life and work of the Rev."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Tsarnaev shouted that the imam was a “nonbeliever.” The younger Tsarnaev brother seems to have rarely attended a mosque at all."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Representative King’s theories also fail to explain why, if young people are being radicalized within mainstream Islamic communities, there aren’t more attacks like the one in Boston."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"By some measures Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the United States, and the last decade has seen a rapid expansion of Muslim institutions across the country."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Yet what’s most obvious to anyone who has spent time in these communities is that whether they are devotional or educational, focused on the arts or on interfaith cooperation and activism, this mediating set of American Muslim institutions is keeping impressionable young Muslims from becoming radicalized."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Take the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center and its range of devotional, arts and educational programs, from preschool to a seminary."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Or Chicago’s Inner-City Muslim Action Network, complete with a medical clinic, civic leadership education and a summer music festival that draws on the biggest names of Muslim hip-hop to promote peace through community organizing."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Or Zaytuna College in Berkeley, Calif., the nation’s first four-year Islamic liberal arts school."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"These institutions and others have different aims, but they abide by a common idea: if the center of Judaism is the law, and the heart of Christianity is love, what Islam requires, above all else, is mercy."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"And whether on display in health care provided for the poor at South Los Angeles’s UMMA Community Clinic, or in a patiently handled Arabic lesson that will one day lead a new convert into the fullness of the tradition, Islamic mercy, preached and practiced within the community, allows no room for radicalization."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Representative King and others have it exactly, completely wrong — the American Muslim community has actively and repeatedly, day in and day out, rejected such radicals on religious grounds: they do not know mercy."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"More than a decade since 9/11, this should no longer be any secret."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"Across the nation, the doors are open, and more are opening every day."
2336,0,No Room for Radicals,"And despite whatever misplaced fears the Boston bombings evoke about radical Islam and homegrown terror, we’ll all find ourselves increasingly secure as more Muslims heed the call — coming to Islam as it is in the United States, as a real, living community."

2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,That’s because they’re from Israel.
2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,"Dr. Kevin (Ilan) Tabb, president and CEO of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston told the Israeli website Ynet that Tsarnaev is in stable condition but that because of wounds to his throat, he may never be able to speak again."

2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,That background gave him a unique perspective in responding to Monday’s terrorist attack.
2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,"“Unfortunately, I have had a lot of experience with these types of injuries after years of treating people injured in terror attacks in Israel,” Tabb said."
2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,"Ynet reports: He told Ynet that the Boston Marathon attack resulted in “numerous leg injuries from the blasts, and there were many amputations as well."

2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,I think one of the reasons for the good treatment the patients received on Monday is because we were already trained for a mass terrorist act at the marathon.
2343,1,Israeli Doctors Are Treating Boston Bombing Suspect: New Details on His Condition,"Like in every year, tens or hundreds of people arrive who get dehydrated or faint at the marathon…” Talmor added."

2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,“The law’s the law.” But even some of the talk show hosts most vehemently opposed to illegal immigration said they were worried that times have changed.
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,They said their listeners seemed less agitated by the prospect that 11 million illegal immigrants might be granted legal status and concede that proponents of the legislation — who now include some conservative radio personalities — are better at promoting their message this time around.
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"The senators filed their 844-page bill after 2 a.m. Wednesday, officially beginning what President Obama and other supporters hope will be a six-week effort to pass it in the Senate by early June."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Hearings on the legislation, which tightens border security and offers an eventual path to citizenship, are set to begin on Friday."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Opponents of the measure are eager to harness the conservative airwaves the way they did in 2007, when talk radio hosts helped whip up a fury of outrage that doomed similar legislation supported by President George W. Bush."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"This time there were 46 talk radio hosts sharing booths in the Phoenix Park Hotel, where they bent over their microphones and broadcast to places like Albany, Salt Lake City and Huntsville, Ala. “So far this has been an inside-the-Beltway echo chamber,” said Bob Dane, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which organized the gathering."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"“What they have not had yet is a good, cold blast of air in the face from the rank-and-file conservative."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,We now have a bill.
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,This is the game-changer where the American public is now starting to weigh in.” But how the public weighs in — and what they say when they call in to the shows — remains an open question.
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Sean Hannity, who in 2007 used his nationally syndicated radio program and perch at Fox News to rail against an immigration overhaul, now says that he has “evolved” and that it is time for Republicans to support some kind of major change in the nation’s immigration system."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Opposition from some Republican lawmakers has softened since the 2012 presidential election, when Mr. Obama won the vast majority of Hispanic votes."

2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"“There are some people who lost their will to fight this fight,” said Ms. Kaufman, who remains combative but admitted in an interview during a commercial break that she was worried the legislation might pass."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"“They think they’ve lost it already and they’ve sort of thrown in the towel, including my fellow radio hosts.” Or as Mr. Schaffer from New Orleans put it, “There is not that rage that was there.” From the beginning of this year’s immigration talks, senators from both parties braced for the reaction on conservative talk radio once the legislation was made public."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Their memories were still fresh from six years ago, when activists at town hall meetings who had listened to talk radio harshly criticized Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for his support of the 2007 proposed legislation."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"This time proponents are hoping that Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a member of the group of eight, will be able to mute the impact of the conservative chatter."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Mr. Rubio, a Tea Party favorite, has spent much of his time in recent months talking about the proposals on conservative radio programs."

2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Michael Medved, one of the few conservative talk show hosts who has always supported an immigration overhaul, said he sensed a shift."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"“What you are not hearing as much, except from a handful of people, is ‘over my dead body,’ ” Mr. Medved said in an interview."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"“The level of apocalyptic hysteria is much less.” There are nonetheless plenty of talk show hosts who disagree with Mr. Hannity and Mr. Medved, as was clear at the Phoenix Park Hotel, where the hosts and activists sported “Border Security Now!” buttons."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Many hosts and callers derided the “gang of eight” senators who drafted the legislation as the “eight gangsters.” But a few blocks away on the East Front of the Capitol, more than 300 evangelical Christian pastors gathered for what they billed as a national day of prayer to support the immigration legislation."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"Unlike 2007, this year evangelicals have mobilized some Christian radio hosts on behalf of immigration and are running saturation ad campaigns summoning evangelicals to obey biblical instructions that call for welcoming the stranger."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"In South Carolina, evangelical leaders ran radio commercials defending Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is an author of the bipartisan bill, and Representative Trey Gowdy, also a Republican."
2347,0,Conservatives See a Turning Tide on Immigration,"The lawmakers were “inundated — very happily inundated” with calls from evangelicals, said Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s policy arm."

2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Due to its complexities, finding common ground can be difficult, however religious leaders like the Rev."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC), believe that it is possible to reach viable — and faith-based — solutions to the domestic conundrum."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"TheBlaze recently interviewed Rodriguez, a prominent evangelical leader, to learn more about how he is tackling this controversial issue."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Considering the role that preachers have in American communities and the work Rodriguez has been engaged in, his perspective on this front is important."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Among other observations, Rodriguez told TheBlaze that Christians’ views on immigration have changed dramatically over the past seven years, noting that progressive and conservative evangelicals, alike, are coming together like never before (we reported on a massive campaign bridging political divides earlier this year called “The Evangelical Immigration Table”)."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"“It’s important to that conservative evangelicals today, as in comparison to seven years ago, serve as probably one of the most significant supportive groups in favor of comprehensive immigration reform,” he said, noting that just a few years ago these same individuals and collectives were opposed."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"“Today, because of groups like the Southern Baptists [and] Liberty Counsel…we are pushing immigration reform and we have a piece of legislation coming forth from Marco Rubio.” Rodriguez noted that he believes the previous stance against reform was rooted in “spiritual, cultural and political myopia.” Rather than a horizontal issue, the faith leader said that conservative evangelicals are now seeing the issue vertically and have woken up to the realities the nation is facing on the immigration front."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Also, outside of the political realm, Rodriguez noted that the most significant growth in Christianity is actually coming from these immigrants, making this as much a religious issue as it is one of policy."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,“Before it was a political issue.
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Now it’s a God and Christian issue,” he continued."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"As for critics who might dismiss plans to provide a path to citizenship and other such proposals, TheBlaze asked how Rodriguez would react to those who believe that illegals broke the law and that, as a result, they shouldn’t be given amnesty."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"“I agree they broke the law and they shouldn’t be given amnesty,” he responded."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,“We have to ask ourselves what is the Biblical solution for those who are here.” Rather than deporting them — something Rodriguez said simply isn’t a viable option — he advocated a more compassionate and understanding approach.
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"He also claimed that many of the 11 million people (estimated) who are here actually came to the country legally at some point, but some “overstayed their VISAs” (a Wall Street Journal report corroborated that 40 percent of illegals did enter the nation legitimately at some point)."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,He said that there’s a fact-versus-fiction paradigm that shows that many of these individuals have actually contributed to their communities.
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,Rodriguez also highlighted his belief that it’s unfair to throw these individuals out when they have been living here for years.

2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"He was the one who said that these immigrants really embody the future of America,” he added."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"“True conservatism [means that] if we are to conserve the spirit of entrepreneurship, we want to welcome these immigrants.” It’s not as though the faith leader wants to open the floodgates."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Rodriguez is, in fact, calling for overarching reform."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"And he’s fully on-board with making illegals go to the back of the line, pay fines, and learn the English language."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,He noted that the process for becoming a citizen should include these benchmarks and that it could — and should — take someone 10 to 13 years to achieve this goal.
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"Now, as for the contention between progressive and conservative evangelicals on a wide variety of issues, Rodriguez spoke candidly about immigration as a uniting force."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"He said that it has been the most unifying issue he’s observed in quite some time among evangelicals — so powerful, in fact, that it has conservative evangelicals like Rodriguez finding common ground with progressives like Sojourners’ Jim Wallis."
2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,"“We coalesce around welcoming the stranger,” he said, noting that Matthew 25 is a key Bible verse in the immigration reform debate."

2347,1,Is Rejecting a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants Un-Christian?,Rodriguez’s comments come at the same time that a bi-partisan immigration plan is being proposed to help cope with the nation’s borders as well as the 11 million illegals who are estimated to be living within them.

2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senators has largely agreed on a broad immigration bill that would require tough border measures to be in place before illegal immigrants could take the first steps to become American citizens, according to several people familiar with drafts of the legislation."
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"But in a delicate compromise worked out over weeks of negotiations, the bill does not impose any specific measurements of border enforcement results that, if they were not met, would stop the immigrants from proceeding toward citizenship."
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"Instead, the bill allows a period of 10 years for the Department of Homeland Security to make plans and use resources to fortify enforcement at the borders and elsewhere within the country before it sets several broader hurdles that could derail the immigrants’ progress toward citizenship if they are not achieved."
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"During the first decade after passage, the bill sets ambitious goals for border authorities — including continuous surveillance of 100 percent of the United States border and 90 percent effectiveness of enforcement in several high-risk sectors — and for other workplace and visa enforcement measures."
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"It provides at least $3 billion for Homeland Security officials to meet those goals during the first five years, with a possibility of additional financing."

2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,It would include a program to finish any border fencing that border agents deem necessary.
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,The plan must also show how the authorities will move quickly to spread technology across the border to ensure that agents can have surveillance capability along its entire length.
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"They will also have five years to reach 90 percent effectiveness in their operations, a measure based on calculations of what percentage of illegal crossers were caught or turned back without crossing."
2363,0,Bipartisan Group of Senators Agrees on Outline of Immigration Bill,"If, after five years, border officials have not reached the surveillance and enforcement goals, the bill establishes a border commission to advise the Department of Homeland Security on how to reach its goals, with additional financing of up to $2 billion."

2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Two prominent senators are working toward forging a compromise proposal on expanded background checks, aiming for a breakthrough on the biggest impasse in controversial gun control legislation."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, an influential moderate, are said to be working on a deal that would allow the checks to apply to purchases at gun shows and Internet sales -- but, importantly, exempt some sales between hunters or close relatives."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"It's unclear whether such a proposal would be embraced by pro-gun rights conservatives and the National Rifle Association, which so far has opposed the kind of comprehensive firearms legislation pushed by President Obama and his allies in Congress."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,But the issue of family members and others being subjected to an expanded background check system for sales between them has become an obstacle.
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"The NRA and other gun-rights advocates, while arguing the checks would eventually lead to a federal gun registry, also said they would be too cumbersome for the two groups – citing faraway trips to government offices and mandatory record keeping."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,They also say criminals would find ways to avoid the checks.
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"The current system covers only sales handled by federally licensed gun dealers, with gun-control advocates saying the country needs to do more to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"They also say the checks and records – now retained by gun dealers, not the government -- are the best ways to ensure those would-be gun buyers' histories are researched."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"A Toomey-Manchin deal on checks could revive legislation, a key part of President Obama’s second-term agenda, to curb gun violence."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"The president has embarked on a fresh round of public appearances in a bid to sway Congress to approve legislation, as it appeared support for the bill was waning."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Obama on Monday will resume that effort, visiting the University of Hartford, in Connecticut, where he is expected to talk about the victims of the mass shooting inside an elementary school in the nearby town of Newtown in December."

2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,They had planned to lobby lawmakers on Tuesday in support of gun control.
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"One problem with a Toomey-Manchin deal is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants to begin debate on the issue Tuesday, now that Congress has returned from a two-week spring break."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"A bipartisan group of eight senators has been working on legislation since the new Congress started in January, just weeks after the school massacre."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Reid already has removed from the Senate plan proposals to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines, after realizing he would not have enough votes."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Those items could still be voted on as amendments to the main package, but their initial inclusion prompted a backlash from lawmakers that continues to hurt the bill's chances."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"A Toomey-Manchin agreement remains a work in progress and could change, said Senate aides who spoke on condition of anonymity."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"But a deal would help gun-control advocates win crucial support from wavering moderate Democrats and from Republican senators, who have largely opposed much of Obama's push on guns."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Manchin is a moderate and Toomey is a conservative, and both senators have received A ratings from the NRA."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"“The background checks in particular are something we need to push ourselves to reach agreement on,” senior West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller said Monday."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"“We know beyond any doubt that right now in America there are too many ways for criminals and the mentally ill to buy guns, especially at gun shows -- and we know how to fix it.” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Monday that a compromise on gun legislation was ""feasible and possible and is also necessary and desirable."""
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"""Senator Toomey's involvement along with Senator Manchin, two very credible and experienced senators, is very important to achieving that kind of common ground,"" Blumenthal told CNN."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Without support from some Republicans, a significant expansion of background checks won't be possible because there are only 53 Democrats in the Senate plus two Democratic-leaning independents."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Conservative Republican senators have promised to use delaying tactics against gun legislation, which would take 60 votes to end."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"Federal background checks are currently required only for transactions handled by the roughly 55,000 federally licensed firearms dealers; private sales such as gun-show or online purchases are exempt."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,Manchin is part of the so-called “Gang of Eight” that has been trying to craft a background check compromise.
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"The group included New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer who has focused his efforts on conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"However, those talks sputtered over Schumer's insistence on -- and Coburn's opposition to -- requiring that records be kept of private gun sales."
2368,1,Senators work on possible breakthrough on gun background checks,"""I'm still hopeful that what I call the sweet spot -- background checks -- can succeed,"" Schumer said Sunday."

2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"Federal policy likely played a role in this - be it the tax hikes from January's fiscal cliff deal, the implementation of Obamacare provisions, or the anticipation of sequestration."
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"People have given up looking for work en masse, and there aren't really any signs of a sharp turnaround coming."
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,There are quite a few explanations for why the economy sputtered in March.
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,The payroll tax hike from January's fiscal cliff deal might have started taking effect.
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,It may be possible that anticipating effects from sequestration would have frozen some employers' payrolls.
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,But what the media likely won't focus on is that Obamacare implementation has weighed heavy on the minds of employers.
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"Paul Howard, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, testified before Congress that: > The consulting firm Mercer predicts that ""more than a third of the nation‘s employers – 38% - have at least some employees for whom coverage would be considered 'unaffordable' under [PPACA]."""
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"The penalty is equal to $3,000 per full-time employee receiving subsidized coverage, or $2,000 per FTE excluding the first 30, whichever is less."
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"(Although Mercer found that more small companies would be affected by the penalty, 31% of employers with 500 or more employees would be at risk, along with 20% of employers with 20,000 or more employees.)"
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,> The play or pay mandate is apt to have a variety of effects on coverage and employment decisions.
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"For employers with 50 or fewer employees who do not offer coverage, it will be a disincentive to grow beyond the ""cap"" and incur the penalty – reducing employment."
2372,1,Jobs Report: Economy Sputters and Stalls in March,"One labor economist notes that the $2,000 penalty will amount to 15% of average wages in the restaurant industry and nearly 10 % of wages in the retail sector – providing an incentive for firms to hire fewer lower-wage workers or become more automated."

2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Republicans know that demographic realities leave them no choice but to embrace some sort of immigration reform.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,But the GOP base — egged along by leading conservative media figures — strongly opposes a path to citizenship for the nation’s undocumented immigrants.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"So many GOP officials have embraced reform as a general goal while stopping short of citizenship, essentially supporting a kind of second class legal status."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,The question is: Who does that position end up pleasing?
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,A new Quinnipiac poll out today offers an answer: Almost nobody.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"It finds that 59 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship, while 25 percent support deportation."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,The third option — staying without citizenship — is supported by only 11 percent.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Among Republicans those numbers are even more interesting.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"It finds that a plurality of 47 percent supports citizenship, while 36 support deportation."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Only 10 percent of Republicans support the staying-without-citizenship option — the very position that is designed to get them to accept reform.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,How can it be that more Republicans support citizenship than deportation?
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,A lot of this has to do with question wording.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Yesterday’s Washington Post poll, for example, found that Republicans oppose citizenship by 60-35."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"But the Post poll only surveyed directly on citizenship, and didn’t offer the range of options that includes citizenship, staying without citizenship, and deportation."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"When that is offered, as the Quinnipiac poll did, the anti-citizenship camp of Republicans is split."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,This tells us something very important about the immigration debate.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"When all three positions are polled — and, in truth, the three options do represent the actual policy choice at the heart of the debate — the concocted “middle ground” position preferred by many GOP officials doesn’t really make anybody happy."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,It doesn’t even make Republicans happy.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Only 10 percent of them support it.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,The problem is that Republicans know that they must be seen embracing some sort of immigration reform.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Yet the base’s opposition to reform is such that not even the proposal to keep undocumented immigrants in a kind of sub-citizenship legal category is enough to get them to support it.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"And so, ultimately, Republicans are going to have to decide: Who is calling the shots here, the sizable chunk of Republican voters who do support citizenship, or the hard core anti-immigration reform-at-all-costs base?"
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Second class citizenship is not the answer to the GOP dilemma here.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Ultimately, Republicans either must bravely cross the path-to-citizenship Rubicon and accept the consequences from the right, or we’re not getting reform."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Another “gun rights” talking point crashes and burns: Glenn Kessler takes apart Lindsey Graham’s claim that out of thousands of people stopped from getting background checks, none were prosecuted."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"The larger point here, as Kessler demonstrates, is that the “gun rights” crowd is basing one of their chief arguments — that we need better enforcement of current laws, but no expansion — on cherry-picked data."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Beyond this, it’s worth noting that the purpose of background checks is to stop transfers of guns to prohibited people, and each time that happens, it has succeeded."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Overwhelming support for expanded background checks: Also from the new Quinnipiac poll: 91 percent of Americans, including 88 percent of Republicans and 88 percent of people from gun-owning households, support “requiring background checks for all gun buyers.” We keep hearing that public sentiment for action on guns has “waned,” but this poll finds that 53 percent support “stricter gun laws,” up one point from February."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"What’s more, support for the actual proposals has not “waned,” which should mean something."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Public thinks marriage should be decided by Constitution: Also from the Quinnipiac poll, this is striking: Do you think each state should make its own law on whether same-sex marriage is legal or illegal there, or do you think this should be decided for all states on the basis of the U.S. Constitution?"
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"State laws: 36 Constitution: 56 With the Supreme Court mulling a ruling on gay marriage cases that could have Constitutional implications, this suggests the public wants this settled already."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Virtually all voter groups — Latinos, Independents, young voters — oppose having the states decide marriage rights, but Republicans support that by, 49-45, underscoring their isolation on the issue."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,The next battle in the immigration wars: Keep an eye on this one: A coalition of labor and faith leaders are joining to oppose any measure in the emerging immigration reform deal that would make it tougher for family members of citizens to join them in the United States.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,Republicans want this because it would lead to more skilled workers coming.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,What’s interesting here is that this could put Republicans at odds with the faith community.

2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Also, this is a reminder that the 2016 Dem presidential contenders are all scrambling to put their stamp on the gun issue (such as Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley), which is rising in importance to Dem voters."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"However, “gun rights” state laws are also on the march: A sobering point from the Wall Street Journal: This year, five states have passed seven laws that strengthen gun restrictions, while 10 states have passed 17 laws that weaken them."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,This isn’t to say that the gun control victories in Maryland and Connecticut aren’t significant; they are.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,But the relentless focus of the “gun rights” brigade on state legislatures is another reminder why we need federal gun law reform.

2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"He sees hope in the Senate: Based on what they have said, a host of GOP senators just might find the daring to tell their party that gutting a background-check bill is foolish, substantively and politically."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"Their ranks include John McCain, who has been brave on this issue in the past, as well as Pat Toomey, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, Mike Johanns, Dean Heller, Johnny Isakson, Saxby Chambliss, Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker and Rob Portman."
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,They hold the key.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,It does look bleak.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,But the hope remains that if enough GOP Senators come on board (Dems will probably have to jettison record keeping to make that happened) it could conceivably force a vote in the House.
2374,0,The Morning Plum: The GOP dilemma on immigration,"And Senate GOPers once supported background checks: Indeed, Alex Seitz-Wald reminds us of an episode that in theory should be relevant today: A number of Senate Republicans voted to close the private seller loophole back in 1999, amid public outcry after the Columbine shooting."

2387,1,"Supreme Court justices question DOMA's range, consider effect act has in states","The federal government has a “powerful interest” in a single, uniform definition of marriage, even if it excludes gay unions that are legal in individual states, the lawyer defending the federal Defense of Marriage Act said Wednesday as the Supreme Court concluded two days of landmark arguments on gay marriage."
2387,1,"Supreme Court justices question DOMA's range, consider effect act has in states","But Paul D. Clement, hired by the House of Representatives to argue for DOMA after the Obama administration refused to do so, faced often skeptical questions from the justices in nearly two hours of arguments centering on the clash between the law’s traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman and a growing number of states that now sanction gay unions."

2387,1,"Supreme Court justices question DOMA's range, consider effect act has in states","And as in Tuesday’s arguments, the justices spent a considerable amount of time considering legal off-ramps that would allow them not to decide the cases, or to issue a far less sweeping ruling than many gay marriage advocates had hoped."

2387,1,"Supreme Court justices question DOMA's range, consider effect act has in states","But Chief Justice Roberts challenged that line of argument, saying the high court was being asked to do something “totally unprecedented.” Justice Kennedy also objected, saying, “I’m wondering if we are living in this new world where the attorney general can simply decide, ‘Yeah, it’s unconstitutional, but it’s not so unconstitutional that I’m not willing to enforce it.’” The plaintiff speaks After Wednesday’s session, Ms. Windsor told reporters she thought the arguments over her case “went beautifully.” The justices took the case “very seriously,” she said, adding that the session was a “spectacular event for my life.” Ms. Kaplan said she was “hopeful” following the oral arguments, and expressed skepticism that — as many legal observers have speculated — the high court might avoid a sweeping decision."

2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,The discrimination embedded in the Defense of Marriage Act is precise yet sweeping.
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"The 1996 statute defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and applies that definition to about 1,100 federal laws and programs."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,One of its many discriminatory results is that same-sex couples are prohibited from collecting many federal benefits available to other couples.
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"That now includes people legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia, plus 18,000 couples who were legally married in California before 2008 when Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage there."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., who is known for his reserve, was unhesitating before the Supreme Court on Wednesday when it heard the Defense of Marriage Act case: “I think it’s time for the court to recognize that this discrimination, excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from federal benefits, cannot be reconciled with our fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law.” It appeared that a majority of the justices, including the likely swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, had serious doubts as to whether the law served any legitimate purpose."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"Justice Kennedy, however, seemed primarily interested in questioning the law for the wrong reasons, concerned that the Defense of Marriage Act interferes in the primary right of states to regulate marriage and its benefits."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,Only the four more liberal justices appeared to focus on the reality that what is at stake here is not federalism but fairness.
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"States can regulate marriage but they cannot discriminate while doing so, and leaving gay and lesbian couples out of the equation violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection just as much as banning interracial marriage."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"Paul Clement, who was defending the act on behalf of the House of Representatives, said its only purpose was to ensure uniformity in distributing federal marriage benefits."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"But Justice Elena Kagan dismissed that notion, suggesting that Congress’s judgment in passing the act was “infected by dislike, by fear, by animus.” Quoting from the House’s legislative history, she said, “Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality.” That clear animus on the part of lawmakers explains why the court must strike down the law on equal-protection grounds, as a federal appeals court did last fall."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"The government needs to have an “exceptionally good” reason to justify treating gay men and lesbians differently, that court ruled, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a similar point today, saying that the law created “two kinds of marriage: the full marriage and then this sort of skim-milk marriage.” Still, no matter what grounds the court eventually uses to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, getting rid of it would be a huge step forward in the national movement toward marriage equality."
2387,0,The Indefensible Marriage Act,"Once it is clear that the only thing standing between same-sex couples and federal benefits is an ideological state legislature, the pressure will accelerate on states to do the right thing, particularly in states like Virginia with large numbers of federal employees."

2388,0,Justices Seem Set to End U.S. Ban on Benefits to Gay Spouses,"The federal government, he said, should respect “the historic commitment of marriage, and of questions of the rights of children, to the states.” That suggests that he is prepared to vote with the court’s four liberal members to strike down the part of the 1996 law that recognizes only the marriages of opposite-sex couples for more than 1,000 federal laws and programs."

2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"Section 3 of DOMA bans the Federal government from extending marriage benefits to same sex couples, even in cases where an individual state has recognized those couples as married."

2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"— SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) March 27, 2013 Subsequently, SCOTUSblog’s main court reporter, Lyle Denniston, posted a longer recap of oral arguments suggesting that section 3o of DOMA had a very weak chance of surviving on the basis of the performance by swing vote Justice Kennedy, albeit for narrower reasons than gay rights advocates might like: Justice Kennedy told Clement that there was “a real risk” that DOMA would interfere with the traditional state authority to regulate marriage."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"Kennedy also seemed troubled about the sweeping breadth of DOMA’s Section 3, noting that its ban on benefits to already married same-sex couples under 1,100 laws and programs would mean that the federal government was “intertwined with citizens’ daily lives.”   He questioned Congress’s very authority to pass such a broad law."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"[…] There did not appear to be a majority of Justices willing to strike down the 1996 law based on the argument that the Obama administration and gay rights advocates have been pressing: that is, the law violates the Fifth Amendment guarantee of legal equality in general."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"[…] The Court, although it has been dealing with gay rights cases for years, has never spelled out a specific constitutional standard for judging laws that allegedly discriminate based on homosexuality."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"The indications on Wednesday that the DOMA case might be decided without supplying such a standard, since a decision based on interference with states’ prerogatives would not require the creation of a test based on equality principles."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"There was a third lawyer in the case to discuss the constitutional issue, New York attorney Roberta A. Kaplan, representing the New York City woman who had successfully challenged DOMA in this case — Edith Schlain Windsor, an eighty-three-year-old widow of a same-sex marriage, who sat in the second row of the audience to watch the Court deal with her case."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"Kaplan seemingly missed several opportunities, in answering the Justices’ questions, to the apparent consternation of gay rights lawyers in the attorney section."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"Talking Points Memo outlined the case in similarly stark terms for supporters of DOMA, describing the hearing as the law “taking a beating,” and pointing out that even the three Justices that seemed to support it (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito) were more preoccupied with arguing over whether the case should be heard than with defending the law."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"Of course, as with any oral argument, it is necessary to note that often the Justices go in completely different direction than the questioning at oral argument indicates, as was the case last year with the Obamacare case HHS v. Florida."
2388,1,Report: Supreme Court '80% Likely' to Strike Defense of Marriage Act,"However, in the event that that happens in this case, it looks likely that the only way it could happen would be if Kennedy decided there was no standing by the court to hear the case, given the irregular appeals process that brought it up."

2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"The House Republicans, the Obama administration and a lawyer appointed by the court were to spend part of the hearing discussing whether the House Republican leadership can defend the law in court because the administration decided not to, and whether the administration forfeited its right to participate in the case because it changed its position and now argues that the provision is unconstitutional."
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"If the Supreme Court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, Windsor probably would still get her refund because she won in the lower courts."
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"But there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books."
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"On Tuesday, the justices weighed a fundamental issue: Does the Constitution require that people be allowed to marry whom they choose, regardless of either partner's gender?"
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,That case involved California's Proposition 8 ban on gay marriage.
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"If the justices choose to rule broadly, they could overturn Prop 8 and in doing so invalidate every other restriction on gay marriage in the country."
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,But the justices suggested Tuesday they could decide the case without issuing a ruling that ripples through all 50 states.
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"Several justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, raised doubts that the case was properly before them."

2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,"Chief Justice John Roberts said it seemed supporters of gay marriage were trying to change the meaning of the word ""marriage"" by including same-sex couples."
2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,Lawyers representing supporters of the California ban known as Proposition 8 argued that the court should not override the democratic process and impose a judicial solution that would redefine marriage in the some 40 states that do not allow same-sex couples to wed.

2389,1,Supreme Court to hear arguments over challenge to federal law in second of gay marriage cases,Americans as a whole are divided on the issue.

2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court dove into a historic debate on gay rights Tuesday that could soon lead to resumption of same-sex marriage in California, but the justices signaled they may not be ready for a major national ruling on whether America's gays and lesbians have a right to marry."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The court's first major examination of gay rights in 10 years continues Wednesday, when the justices will consider the federal law that prevents legally married gay couples from receiving a range of benefits afforded straight married people."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The issue before the court on Tuesday was more fundamental: Does the Constitution require that people be allowed to marry whom they choose, regardless of either partner's gender?"
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The fact that the question was in front of the Supreme Court at all was startling, given that no state recognized same-sex unions before 2003 and 40 states still don't allow them."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,There is no questioning the emotions the issue stirs.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Demonstrators on both sides crowded the grounds outside the court, waving signs, sometimes chanting their feelings."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Inside, a skeptical Justice Samuel Alito cautioned against a broad ruling in favor of gay marriage precisely because the issue is so new."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"""You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution which is newer than cellphones or the Internet?"
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"I mean, we do not have the ability to see the future,"" Alito said."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Indeed, it was clear from the start of the 80-minute argument in a packed courtroom, that the justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, had doubts about whether they should even be hearing the challenge to California's Proposition 8, the state's voter-approved gay marriage ban."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Justice Anthony Kennedy, the potentially decisive vote on a closely divided court, suggested the justices could dismiss the case with no ruling at all."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Such an outcome would almost certainly allow gay marriages to resume in California but would have no impact elsewhere.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"There was no majority apparent for any particular outcome, and many doubts were expressed by justices about the arguments advanced by lawyers for the opponents of gay marriage in California, by the supporters and by the Obama administration, which is in favor of same-sex marriage rights."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,The administration's entry into the case followed President Barack Obama's declaration of support for gay marriage.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"On the one hand, Kennedy acknowledged the recentness of same-sex unions, a point stressed repeatedly by Charles Cooper, the lawyer for the defenders of Proposition 8. Cooper said the court should uphold the ban as a valid expression of the people's will and let the vigorous political debate over gay marriage continue."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"But Kennedy pressed him also to address the interests of the estimated 40,000 children in California who have same-sex parents."

2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?"""
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Kennedy said.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Yet when Theodore Olson, the lawyer for two same-sex couples, urged the court to support such marriage rights everywhere, Kennedy feared such a ruling would push the court into ""uncharted waters."""
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Olson said that the court similarly ventured into the unknown in 1967 when it struck down bans on interracial marriage in 16 states.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Kennedy challenged the accuracy of that comment, noting that other countries had had interracial marriages for hundreds of years."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The justice, whose vote usually decides the closest cases, also made clear he did not like the rationale of the federal appeals court that struck down Proposition 8, even though it cited earlier opinions in favor of gay rights that Kennedy had written."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"That appeals court ruling applied only to California, where same-sex couples briefly had the right to marry before the state's voters in November 2008 adopted Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Several members of the court also were troubled by the Obama administration's main contention that when states offer same-sex couples civil union rights of marriage, as California and eight other states do, they also must allow marriage."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The other states are: Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"""So a state that has made considerable progress has to go all the way, but at least the government's position is, if the state has done absolutely nothing at all, then it can do as it will,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether gay marriage proponents were arguing over a mere label.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"""Same-sex couples have every other right."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"It's just about the label,"" Roberts said."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"In the California case, if the court wants to find an exit without making a decision about gay marriage, it has two basic options."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"It could rule that the opponents have no right, or legal standing, to defend Proposition 8 in court."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Such an outcome also would leave in place the trial court decision in favor of the two same-sex couples who sued for the right to marry.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"On a practical level, California officials probably would order county clerks across the state to begin issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples, although some more conservative counties might object."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Alternatively, the justices could determine that they should not have agreed to hear the case in the first place, as happens a couple of times a term on average."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"In that situation, the court issues a one-sentence order dismissing the case ""as improvidently granted."""
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The effect of that would be to leave in place the appeals court ruling, which in the case of Proposition 8, applies only to California."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The appeals court also voted to strike down the ban, but on somewhat different grounds than the trial court."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Reflecting the high interest in this week's cases, the court released an audio recording of Tuesday's argument shortly after it concluded and plans to the do same Wednesday."

2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,A good part of the give-and-take Tuesday concerned Cooper's argument that the state has a legitimate interest in limiting marriage to heterosexuals since they have the unique ability to have children.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"He and Justice Elena Kagan engaged in a lengthy, sometimes humorous, exchange on the topic."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"If a state can use the ability to have children as a reason to prohibit same-sex marriage, what about couples over the age of 55?"
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Kagan asked.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"""Your Honor, even with respect to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that both parties to the couple are infertile,"" Cooper said."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Kagan cut in: ""I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage."""
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"At another point, Justice Antonin Scalia, who has dissented in the court's previous gay rights cases, invoked the well-being of children to bolster Cooper's case."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"""If you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not,"" Scalia said."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,The California case was argued 10 years to the day after the court took up a challenge to Texas' anti-sodomy statute.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,That case ended with a forceful ruling prohibiting states from criminalizing sexual relations between consenting adults.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"Kennedy was the author of the decision in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and he is being closely watched for how he might vote on the California ban."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"He cautioned in the Lawrence case that it had nothing to do with gay marriage, but dissenting Justice Scalia predicted the decision would lead to the invalidation of state laws against same-sex marriage."
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,Kennedy's decision is widely cited in the briefs in support of same-sex unions.
2391,1,California gay marriage argument at high court Tuesday,"The California couples, Kris Perry and Sandy Stier of Berkeley and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, filed their federal lawsuit in May 2009 to overturn the same-sex marriage ban that voters approved the previous November."

2392,0,Is support for gay marriage over-sold?,Polls measuring opposition to gay marriage (denoted by the white dots) very often come in below the actual opposition to gay marriage on Election Day (denoted by the gray line).
2392,0,Is support for gay marriage over-sold?,The best example of the discrepancy between the polls and the actual vote may be the same gay marriage ban that comes before the Supreme Court this week -- California's Proposition 8.
2392,0,Is support for gay marriage over-sold?,While polling regularly showed more opposition to the ban (i.e.

2392,0,Is support for gay marriage over-sold?,"There are a couple theories for this discrepancy, setting aside the notion that the pollsters themselves might be biased: 1) Polls under-sell opposition to gay marriage because people don't want to come off as intolerant of gay people, so they hide their true anti-gay marriage beliefs from pollsters."

2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,Former Florida Gov.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"Jeb Bush, blanketing the Sunday talk shows, vigorously denied charges leveled at him in the past week that he’s shifted his views on immigration reform as other Republicans eyeing potential 2016 presidential bids jockey for position on the issue."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,Mr. Bush said he still favors a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and is on the same page with a bipartisan group of senators crafting such a bill after his new book outlining a “pathway to residency” for those in the country illegally drew fire from both the right and the left last week.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"“I … think that a path to citizenship, so long as the ability of someone to come legally is easier and less costly than coming illegally, then a path to citizenship is appropriate, and I applaud the work of the senators and others in the Congress that are working to try to craft a consensus and a compromise on this issue,” Mr. Bush said on “Fox News Sunday.” SPECIAL COVERAGE: Immigration Reform But in his new book, “Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution,” Mr. Bush writes that he favors a path to residency, rather than citizenship, for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country, and that they should have to leave the country and reapply if they truly want to get U.S. citizenship."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and a member of the “Gang of Eight,” said last week that such a stance “undercuts” what the senators are trying to accomplish."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,But Mr. Bush said he had talked with Mr. Graham and they are on the same page — and that his views on the issue have been consistent despite backing a pathway to citizenship earlier in his career.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"“I haven’t changed,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “I support a path to legalization or citizenship so long as the path for people that have been waiting patiently is easier and costs less, the legal entrance to our country, than illegal entrance.” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, disagreed."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"“Let’s wait for a few minutes and see how Jeb Bush changes his mind, again,” Mr. Reid told reporters last week."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,“His opinion on immigration is not evolving; it’s devolving.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"He keeps going backwards.” President Obama, who had pledged to pass comprehensive immigration reform in his first term, has made the issue one of his top priorities for his second."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,But Republicans working on the issue have a tricky needle to thread between distancing themselves from the president and potentially alienating Latino voters.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,Republican Sens.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky immediately blasted a framework for immigration reform leaked by the White House last month that included a path to citizenship as part of the plan.
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"Mr. Rubio has been widely viewed as a potential 2016 nominee, and Mr. Paul’s stock rose tremendously in that regard after waging a filibuster that lasted nearly 13 hours last week and ended up as a scathing critique of the White House’s policy on drone aircraft."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"Mr. Rubio, whose parents emigrated to the United States from Cuba, favors a pathway to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally, and Mr. Bush said his views “absolutely” coincide with those."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"“I applaud what Senator Rubio’s doing, the other members of the so-called Gang of Eight — they’re making a major contribution,” Mr. Bush said on “Face the Nation.” “And there’s also efforts in the House of Representatives as well."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"This is a very encouraging time, because if we can get immigration right, imagine, there’s possibilities of cats and dogs living with one another in other policy areas as well.” But Mr. Bush flatly dismissed the notion that the events of the past week or his book had anything to do with political maneuvering for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,"“Yeah, see, that’s the Washington world, the world of everything has to have a personal political ambition, motive,” he said."
2415,1,Jeb Bush: Not much daylight between immigration plans,“That’s not the case.

2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","BERKELEY, Calif. NEARLY 700 miles of walls now separate the United States and Mexico."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Would-be migrants still find ways over, under, through and around them."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","As a tool for controlling immigration to the United States, the border fortifications have been remarkably ill suited to the task."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",And yet these barriers are having a significant and lasting effect nonetheless: they are harming communities on both sides of the border.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",We should tear them down before the damage becomes irreparable.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","After Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush instructed the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize the construction of fortifications along the Mexican border."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",The result has been an astonishing array of barriers across America’s southern frontier.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","The number of Border Patrol agents doubled in seven years to more than 21,000."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","And interior enforcement was expanded to identify, detain, prosecute and deport undocumented migrants."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","From the numbers, it might seem as if such efforts have worked to stem illegal immigration."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Today, Border Patrol apprehensions have fallen to levels seen in the mid-1970s."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","But evidence suggests this decline has less to do with tightened enforcement than with economic factors: the reductions have been driven largely by weak job prospects in the United States and a resurgent economy in Mexico, which have kept more would-be migrants at home."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Even so, President Obama has continued most of Mr. Bush’s programs — and, in fact, increased deportations to nearly 410,000 in 2012, the highest number ever."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",The vast majority of these deportations were to Mexico.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Two principal agencies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, spent nearly $18 billion in 2012 — enforcing what Janet Napolitano, the secretary of Homeland Security, calls a no-nonsense approach to immigration."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Such an effort is necessary, she said, in order for voters to support comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","But rather than no-nonsense, America’s approach to building walls has been nonsensical."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Along the river boundary, the wide meanders of the Rio Grande made it impossible to build a continuous, straight-line fence."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","So the barriers were constructed north of the river — slicing off part of a nature reserve here, a few holes of a golf course there and cutting a university campus in two."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",United States citizens stranded on the “Mexican side” of the interior divide wonder if they now live in Mexico.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Barriers in Texas, moreover, are disproportionately located in poor and minority communities — a pattern that is so clear that it sometimes becomes farcical: plans for one fence, for instance, show it ending abruptly at the edge of a billionaire’s property."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Inside Arizona, checkpoints have been established on major freeways."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Posted signs report the number of arrests made and kilos of narcotics seized, but many commuters are just plain irritated by the delays."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Government agencies have arrived to enforce immigration law, and some Arizonans have taken to welcoming visitors to their “police state.” Many locals lost patience with a pilot project to build nine surveillance towers north of the borderline, complaining that the cameras were pointed at them, not toward Mexico."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Members of the Tohono O’odham Nation, whose territory is bisected by the international boundary, have felt especially aggrieved by what they view as a reoccupation of their land by federal agents."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","In California, during the fence-building frenzy of 2009, I met a Border Patrol agent and project engineer at Smuggler’s Gulch — a deep canyon near the Pacific Ocean where the Department of Homeland Security had dumped in an estimated 2 million cubic yards of dirt and then fenced in the landfill to prevent access from Mexico."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","The canyon stream still flowed across the border, so engineers built a tunnel under the landfill to permit the water’s passage."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","The tunnel entrance and exit were gated, but the agent predicted that migrants would soon use the tunnel to cross."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","“Ninety percent of this is politics,” said the engineer."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Borderlanders have done their best to adjust to this increasingly bizarre world.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Crossing times at the border first doubled, then tripled, from what they had been before the fences, but people learned to factor the holdups into their commute times."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Television news programs even began reporting crossing delays along with the weather report.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Such adjustments, though, barely mitigate the outrage that many Americans feel toward the encroachment of hideous barriers into their once open land."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Nor do these daily adjustments change the fact that the border fence is harming an ancient human ecosystem.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Mutual interdependence has always been a hallmark of cross-border lives.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Residents on both sides of the line regard parts of Mexico and the United States as their home.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","For them, the border is a connective membrane, not a line of demarcation."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Often describing themselves as “transborder citizens,” they have more in common with one another than with their host nations."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Besides sentiments of belonging and shared destiny, this “third nation,” as it is known, is bolstered by synergistic local economies."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Border states are among the fastest-growing regions in both countries.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Ciudad Juárez, once a city of 1.5 million, lost about a quarter-million inhabitants who fled from drug cartel-related violence to various destinations across Mexico."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Yet the city’s industries continue to add jobs, fostering some $80 billion in trade between Juárez and neighboring El Paso in 2011, a $10 billion increase from the previous year."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","In El Paso, the arrival of 30,000 sanctuary seekers from Juárez created a boom in real estate and restaurant businesses."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Cross-border institutions also reinforce binational ties.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","For more than a century, the International Boundary and Water Commission, with representatives from the United States and Mexico, has overseen water issues along the border and supported joint development projects."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","The border fence, however, undermines this cooperation and cohesion, as it splinters lives and scars landscapes."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Likewise, to many who live here, the border patrols, with their ever watching drones, feel more like an occupying army."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",Add to this the enormous expense of maintaining the fortifications — estimated to be $6.5 billion over the next 20 years — and it’s clear that the costs of these structures far outweigh any benefit they offer in deterring illegal immigration.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall",We can prevent further waste by just demolishing the Mexico-United States Barrier today.
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","Of course, whether we act boldly now or not, it will eventually come down, just as other barriers have fallen."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","The Berlin Wall was demolished virtually overnight, its fragments sold as souvenirs of a bygone cold war."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","When it is finally recognized for what it is — a manifestation of a failed immigration policy — our border fence will fall to angry residents, avid recyclers and souvenir hunters."
2415,0,"Mr. President, Tear Down This Wall","When that happens, someone ought to preserve a few sections for the Smithsonian, to mark the moment when America’s national identity is again defined by something more durable than a strip of steel."

2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,Well Arkansas has officially become the state with the most restrictive abortion law and has made a case for life.
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,The new law is a near-ban on abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy.
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"Unless a lawsuit or court action intervenes before it takes effect this summer, it looks like Arkansas will become the toughest state to get an abortion after the 3 month mark."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature defied Gov.
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"Mike Beebe, overriding the Democrat's veto."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"The House voted 56-33 on Wednesday to override Beebe's veto, a day after the Senate voted to do the same."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,The votes come less than a week after the Legislature overrode a veto of a separate bill banning most abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy.
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"That bill took effect immediately after the final override vote, whereas the 12-week ban won't take effect until this summer."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"Abortion rights advocates say they will sue over this vote, but those who advocated and voted for this law are not scared of this challenge."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"The governor, who has continually stated that these laws are unconstitutional due to the Roe v. Wade decision, will face opponents from the Right."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"""Not the governor, nor anyone else other than the courts, can determine if something is constitutional or unconstitutional,"" Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Hot Springs, said in urging his colleagues to override Beebe."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"Bill sponsor Sen. Jason Rapert, a Republican from Conway, watched the vote from the House gallery and said a number of law firms have offered to help the state defend the laws in court, if it comes to that."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"""I'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"The eyes of the entire nation were on the Arkansas House of Representatives today,"" he said."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,This 12-week ban will prohibit abortions from the point when a baby’s heart rate can be heard through an abdominal ultrasound.
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"“It includes exemptions for rape, incest, the life of the mother and highly lethal fetal disorders."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"The 20-week prohibition, which is based on the disputed claim that a fetus can feel pain by the 20th week and therefore deserves protection from abortion, includes all of the same exemptions except for fetal disorders.” And 6 Democrats even crossed the aisle to join Republicans on this vote."
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,"So if you can hear the heartbeat at 12 weeks, how is it that anti-abortion advocates can claim it is not a live being in there?"
2420,1,Arkansas Becomes Biggest Advocate for Life,Thank you to Arkansas for standing with the women and children of your state and protecting their lives.

2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"For two long years, Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez’s Cuban medical team perpetrated a colossal deception of the Venezuelan people and the world about his bout with terminal cancer."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"According to knowledgeable sources, Cuban doctors botched the initial treatment that doomed Chavez, manipulated his anxiety and paranoia so he would settle for substandard medical care in Havana, and pushed him back on to the campaign trail despite the impact on his health."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Quite plainly, the Cuban regime traded Chávez’s life for its own survival – knowing that its bankrupt economy depends on Venezuelan generosity."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Unfortunately, the Cubans are not done administering to Venezuela – putting that country’s constitution under the knife."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Article 233 of that charter says, in part, “When an elected president becomes permanently unavailable to serve prior to his inauguration, a new election by universal suffrage and direct ballot shall be held within 30 consecutive days."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Pending election and inauguration of the new president, the president of the National Assembly shall take charge of the presidency of the Republic.” [Emphasis added] [pullquote] Today, Chávez is as “permanently unavailable to serve” as president of Venezuela as anyone can be."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"He was out of the country and unable to take the oath of office on Jan. 10, when his new term should have commenced; the cronies on his supreme court pushed back his inauguration to a time convenient to the president."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"So, he was never inaugurated and never will be."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,A plain reading of Article 233 makes National Assembly chief Diosdado Cabello the custodian of the presidency until new elections can be held.
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"But Havana does not like Cabello, and the feeling is mutual."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Havana favors Nicolas Maduro, whom Chávez named late last year as vice president."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"If Chávez had taken the oath of office and initiated his new term, Maduro might have some claim to succession."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"However, Chávez’s term was never inaugurated, so there is no mandate for Maduro to claim."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Indeed, the moment Chávez died, Maduro became no one’s vice president."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,The Cubans have no choice but to run the risk of awakening Venezuelan nationalism.
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Not only did they essentially sequester another country’s president for the last 90 days, they even summoned Venezuelan ministers to Havana to hold imaginary cabinet meetings."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"In recent weeks, university students have protested Cuban interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,Nationalistic military officers – most of whom favor the veteran Cabello and were trained to oppose Cuban communism – have grumbled about Havana’s heavy-handed stage-managing of a succession that favors Havana’s selfish interests.
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"According to sources in Venezuela, the country’s security forces are divided – with most of the military muscle lining up behind Cabello."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"However, with 30,000 Cubans – including disciplined mobile hit squads – roaming the streets and monitoring the movements of every Venezuelan military officer, Havana will put up a fight."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"If that sparks a civil war in which thousands of Venezuelans might die, so be it."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"After years of ignoring Chávez’s authoritarianism, the international community might finally muster the courage to speak up to prevent bloodshed."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,The solution appears to be fairly straightforward:  a constitutional succession and new elections to choose a president.
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"If Maduro wants to be president and defender of the Venezuelan Constitution, he can play by the rules and compete for the job."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Of course, before the democratic opposition hits the campaign trail yet again, they are insisting on simple but profound reforms to ensure a level playing field and a fair process in which all the votes are counted."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"These concepts might be alien to a bunch of thugs from Cuba, but Venezuelans have gotten fairly used to elections of one sort or another."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"If Havana gets its way on interpreting the Venezuelan Constitution in a manner that hands power to its puppet, who can object when Cuba vetoes new elections?"
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"And if new elections are held, does anyone expect the Castro brothers to risk holding a freer or fairer process?"
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"In recent months, the U.S. State Department has found itself in the awkward position of favoring Havana’s hand-picked candidate, holding secret talks with Maduro beginning last November aimed at normalizing bilateral relations."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"Yesterday, Maduro rewarded the naïveté of U.S. diplomats by expelling two military officers assigned to the U.S. Embassy for allegedly destabilizing Venezuela; he also suggested that Chávez might have been poisoned."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"As of this morning, it is not too late for Washington to be as effective as Havana when it comes to defending our values and interests."
2421,1,Cuba's coup de grace in Venezuela,"By this afternoon, the Cubans’ coup de grâce against Venezuela’s constitution may be irreversible."

2422,0,Now Dems worry: Did President Obama cry wolf?,"… They spent two weeks building up sequester as a horror show and then got fact-checked a dozen times and were forced to back off their own claims of it being a disaster once they were forced to acquiesce to the cuts happening.” ( Also on POLITICO: Koch-backed group says Obama’s hyping) The cuts are coming, many after a one-month delay — and local media around the country were busily reporting details of tower closures at 173 small- to medium-sized airports by April 7."

2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"ANALYSIS/OPINION: Washington’s fiscal problem can be succinctly summarized: It’s the spending, Stupid."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"For anyone still doubting, you need look no further than the Congressional Budget Office’s just-released estimates for the next decade."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"The verdict: Federal outlays spiked with the recession, remained high and will rise from there – even with their recent hike, revenues simply cannot keep pace."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Like a connect-the-dot picture, CBO’s “The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023” lays out the salient points of Washington’s fiscal dilemma."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,The image is not pretty.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,What passes for good news comes this year.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,The federal deficit is projected to fall below $1 trillion for the first time in five years.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,It is expected to remain a staggering $845 billion – roughly $400 billion more than the amount for which the Bush administration was assailed in 2008.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Then the bad news really begins: “Deficits are projected to increase later in the coming decade, however, because of the pressures of an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt.” The key point from that fearsome foursome is that all of these are due to growing spending."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Yet could not falling revenues, as occurred during the recession and subsequent “slow recovery seen since the recession ended in mid-2009” still be a culprit?"
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"According to CBO estimates, the New Year’s tax hike has addressed that issue – but good."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,“Federal revenues will increase by roughly 25 percent between 2013 and 2015…[and] revenues are projected to grow from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2015 – compared with an average of 17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years.” Washington’s fiscal problem is that spending will also be above its past levels – only more so.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"“Although outlays are projected to decline from 22.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 21.5 percent of GDP by 2017, they will still exceed their 4-year average of 21 percent.” They also resume growing – reaching 22.9 percent of GDP by decade’s end – while revenues on the other hand stay at their current GDP ratio."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"To underscore that spending, not falling revenues, is driving the deficit: “Under CBO’s baseline projections, most of the decline in the deficit in the next two years is the result of a projected significant rise in revenues, which are estimated to increase by 25 percent between 2013 and 2015.” OK, that’s “then,” but isn’t the present deficit the fault of revenues?"
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Actually, “federal revenues increased by $147 billion (or 6 percent) in 2012, and they are projected to grow by $259 billion (or 11 percent) in 2013.” In comparison, had it not been for a federal payment shift, “outlays in fiscal year 2012 would have been about the same as in fiscal year 2011.” So revenues increased – at almost three times the economy’s growth rate – while spending stayed flat."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,Flat is decidedly not what federal spending has been during the recession.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"It increased $535 billion from 2008 to 2009, an 18 percent jump."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Simultaneously, the deficit increased by almost $1 trillion – from $459 billion to $1.413 trillion."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Spending peaked at $3.6 trillion in 2011, and there it has pretty much stayed – $3.5 trillion in 2012 and an estimated $3.6 trillion again this year."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,The verdict on what happened to the federal budget is clear.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"During the recession, spending spiked; there it stayed for three years, and soon it will begin to soar…again."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,There is no way for revenues to keep up with it and for the economy to keep growing at the same time.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"Precisely identifying Washington’s spending dynamic, CBO sums up: Not only are an aging population, increased health care cost and subsidies, Social Security spending and debt service costs the spending problem, but “spending on all other programs – in the aggregate – is projected to decline relative to GDP between 2014 and 2023.” The spending problem is real, it is not new, it is not going away, it is going to get worse, and it is due to the four areas identified."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"To address it, Washington must not only reach the heretofore elusive “grand bargain,” but that agreement must be centered on entitlement reform, putting these programs on a sustainable course."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,"This needs to be done before interest rate increases spur debt service costs, and entitlements really begin their explosion."
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,If this spending threat sounds all too familiar – you need only look to Europe to see why.
2428,1,YOUNG: Washington still doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it,It is past time for Washington finally to recognize that the unaffordable is not unavoidable.

2432,0,Voting Rights Act under fire at Supreme Court,"During contentious oral arguments, several liberal justices argued vigorously in favor of preserving a portion of the 1965 law which requires parts or all of 16 states to get permission from the Justice Department or a court before changing voting requirements or redrawing election districts."
2432,0,Voting Rights Act under fire at Supreme Court,"Story Continued Below However, the court’s conservatives seemed persuaded that when Congress renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years in 2006, lawmakers lacked a sufficient basis for essentially keeping as is the list of states subject to the unusual pre-approval rule, known as Section 5."
2432,0,Voting Rights Act under fire at Supreme Court,"Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the court needed to step in because the overwhelming, bipartisan vote in favor of renewing the law in 2006 showed that lawmakers were reluctant to disturb what amounted to a “racial entitlement.” “I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said."

2432,0,Voting Rights Act under fire at Supreme Court,"“No,” said Rein, who said the measure was Congress’s response “to a problem of race discrimination which it thought was prevalent in certain jurisdictions.” Earlier, Rein began his argument by arguing that there had been “unmistakable” change in the South in the nearly half-century since the the law was passed."
2432,0,Voting Rights Act under fire at Supreme Court,"That assertion, too, provoked Sotomayor."
2432,0,Voting Rights Act under fire at Supreme Court,"“Assuming some portions of the South have changed, your county pretty much hasn’t,” she interjected."

2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"WASHINGTON — The White House is working on early drafts of a comprehensive bill that would offer 11 million illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship along the lines of the principles that the president laid out in Las Vegas several weeks ago, administration officials said."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,President Obama revealed last month that his administration had already drafted immigration legislation.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,But he said he preferred to let a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers work out their own bill that could also tighten border security and provide employers with a way to verify the citizenship status of workers.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,White House aides said that Mr. Obama remained pleased with the progress being made on Capitol Hill toward a complete overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,But they said he would be prepared to submit legislation if the effort among lawmakers stalls.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"“The president has made clear the principles upon which he believes any common-sense immigration reform effort should be based,” Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman, said in a statement."

2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,The newspaper said the bill would allow illegal immigrants to become permanent residents within eight years and in the meantime apply for a “Lawful Prospective Immigrant” visa.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,Mr. Stevens and other White House officials declined to comment on specific details of the report.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,Those details are similar to the statement of principles that the White House provided to reporters after Mr. Obama’s Las Vegas speech.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"A fact sheet said the president wanted to strengthen border security, provide “earned citizenship,” streamline legal immigration and crack down on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"“Immigrants living here illegally must be held responsible for their actions by passing national security and criminal background checks, paying taxes and a penalty, going to the back of the line, and learning English before they can earn their citizenship,” the fact sheet said."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"“There will be no uncertainty about their ability to become U.S. citizens if they meet these eligibility criteria.” In a statement late Saturday night, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, criticized Mr. Obama, saying that the details reported in the USA Today article represented legislation that “is half-baked and seriously flawed.” “It would actually make our immigration problems worse,” he said."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"Mr. Rubio, who has been among the leading Republicans pushing for a comprehensive overhaul of immigration, predicted that a bill like the one reported would be “dead on arrival in Congress.” But Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, an independent nonpartisan research center in Washington, said the eight-year temporary status for illegal immigrants in the document obtained by USA Today was “essentially the same as the probationary status” envisioned in a proposal developed by a bipartisan group of eight senators."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"During that probationary period, Mr. Papademetriou said, immigrants would have temporary visas with full work authorization."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,The bipartisan Senate proposal calls for additional border security and more effective enforcement to curb illegal immigration.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,And it would require that “enforcement measures be complete before any immigrant on probationary status can earn a green card.” It was not immediately clear whether the White House would support such linkage.

2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,White House officials are betting that Republicans will be eager to embrace immigration changes as a way of repairing their image with an important voting bloc.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"But getting legislation passed remains tricky, especially in the Republican-controlled House, and Mr. Obama has made it clear he will take a back seat to lawmakers if it will help."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"Negotiations are taking place among a bipartisan group of senators, a separate group in the House, and labor leaders and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, praised Mr. Obama’s tone on the issue last week, saying the president “actually doesn’t want to politicize this, which is conducive to getting something done.” On Wednesday, the White House said Mr. Obama met with Democratic senators at the White House to get a status report on the pace of progress on the legislation."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"In a statement after the meeting, White House officials said the president reiterated his pledge to become more involved if necessary."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,The statement said Mr. Obama told them “he expects the process to continue to move forward and stands ready to introduce his own legislation if Congress fails to act.” It remains unclear how long the president is willing to wait.
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,"In interviews with Spanish-language television stations after his speech last month, Mr. Obama suggested that he wanted to see real progress by March, when lawmakers had said they hoped to have reached an agreement."
2450,0,The White House Continues Working on Immigration Legislation of Its Own,“If they can get a piece of legislation debated on the floor by March I think that’s a good timeline.

2452,0,Chuck Hagel Confirmation: Senate Vote Fails To End Filibuster On Obama Pick,This is a developing story and has been updated.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,Senate Republicans have at least temporarily blocked the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel as the next Secretary of Defense.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Democrats' cloture motion to proceed to an up-or-down vote failed 58-40, with one Senator voting ""present."""
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,Achieving cloture requires 60 votes.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Let's be candid: Hagel (a Republican) is unqualified for this job, which is arguably the most important position in a presidential cabinet."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"He all but admitted as much during his disastrous Senate hearings last month: During prickly exchanges with his former Senate colleagues, Hagel downplayed and ""clarified"" previous denunciations of the, er, ""Jewish lobby,"" which he once accused of regularly ""intimidating"" members of Congress."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"He also butchered the administration's position on a nuclear Iran, twice getting his facts wrong."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Eventually a sympathetic Democrat was forced to step in and rescue the floundering witness: Matters didn't improve when Mr. Hagel announced, regarding Iran's nuclear capacity, that he supported the president's strong position on ""containment."""
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"But the administration's policy is not, as Mr. Hagel apparently had yet to learn, containment—it is to prevent Iran's development of nuclear arms."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Nudged by a note handed him by an aide, the nominee corrected himself and declared that in fact the U.S. doesn't have a policy on containment."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"This was one misstatement too many for Carl Levin—the committee chairman, a Democrat and supporter of Mr. Hagel's nomination—who ended the discussion with his own terse correction: ""We do have a position on containment, and that is we do not favor containment."""
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,Even many Democrats and media commentators didn't bother sugarcoating Hagel's dreadful performance.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Republicans have continued to hammer away at Hagel for his record on Israel, Iran, and terrorism -- including votes against tougher sanctions on the Iranian regime and a refusal to classify Iran's revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Hagel was also the only US Senator who declined to sign a statement decrying anti-Semitism in Russia, though he says his refusal to sign had nothing to do with the content of the letter."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Just today, another blast from Hagel's rhetorical past came to light: Fox News Channel on Tuesday reported that secretary of defense nominee Chuck Hagel failed to disclose to the United States Senate speeches delivered to controversial groups such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee as well as James Zogby’s Arab American Institute."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Meanwhile, a 2007 speech then-Sen. Hagel delivered at Rutgers University in New Jersey as he tested the waters for a presidential run is drawing fresh scrutiny."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Hagel said the U.S. Department of State was an adjunct of the Israeli foreign minister’s office, according to a contemporaneous report of the event."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"President Obama's nominee for Secretary of Defense is testy about the influence of the ""Jewish lobby"" and basically said that the State Department is run by Israel."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,The government of Iran has effectively endorsed his nomination.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Opponents of the nomination are demanding more financial disclosures from Hagel, particularly regarding foreign income; the White House is fighting these calls for increased transparency, as are many Congressional Democrats who once demanded similar information from Bush appointees."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"In short, Hagel is an incompetent who was utterly unprepared for his confirmation hearings, has demonstrated an enduring hostility towards Israel and possibly Jews generally, and has a voting record that's worrisomely soft on outlaw regimes that threaten our security."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"And yet he enjoys universal support among Senate Democrats, whose only apparent standard for a evaluating a nominee for a critical position is whether or not the man who picked him is named 'Barack Obama.'"
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"It's widely believed, incidentally, that the president is high on Hagel because he'll provide some helpful bipartisan gloss when Obama makes deep military cuts."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Which brings us to another disquieting moment of candor:  Unless Republicans can unearth additional damaging oppo research on Hagel, he will be confirmed sooner or later."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Parting thought, via Allahpundit: Serious question: If Hagel doesn’t deserve to be blocked, who does?"
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"His opponents have seized on his anti-Israel rhetoric, more of which emerges every week, but as contemptible as it is, I don’t think that’s reason to filibuster."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Democrats are right when they say that the president deserves wide latitude in choosing his cabinet; if The One wants to bear the political consequences of appointing a guy known for babbling about the “Jewish lobby,” that’s on him."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,The reason to block Hagel is that he’s manifestly unprepared for the job and isn’t all that shy about admitting it.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,When concerns about a nominee shift from political disagreement to questions about his basic competence then the “advise and consent” role should require stopping the nomination even with a filibuster.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"At that point it’s no longer a dispute over foreign policy, it’s about protecting the military from mismanagement."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,Typically you don’t worry about a president putting the Senate in a position like that but Obama wants his Republican rubber-stamp nominee so he’s willing to skimp on qualifications.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,He deserves to have a pick this cynical blocked.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,UPDATE \- Harry Reid reacted to the cloture failure by grumpily carrying on about how Republicans' obstructionism has caused a crisis by leaving the nation with no acting Secretary of Defense.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Unsurprisingly, this is a lie."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Reid voted 'no' with Republicans, a procedural manuever that allows him to call a follow-up vote in the coming days."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,UPDATE II \- Some Republican Senators are now pledging to allow a vote on Hagel next week.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Meanwhile, Jennifer Rubin has video of Hagel giving a speech to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League in which he complains about the United States trying to ""dictate"" to Iran over its illegal nuclear program."
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Rubin replies:  ""We can’t 'dictate' to Iran?"
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,We are of course attempting to enforce multiple United Nations sanctions and resolutions of which Iran is in violation.
2452,1,Senate Republicans Block Hagel Confirmation....For Now,"Does he take the side of Iran, that it has a 'right' to pursue its nuclear weapons program?"""

2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"Under a deal the Obama administration reached with automakers in 2011, vehicles will have a corporate average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, twice the 27 miles per gallon, on average, that cars and trucks get today."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,Automobile manufacturers won't start making changes to achieve the new fuel economy standards until model year 2017.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"Not all cars will double their gas mileage, since the standard is based on an average of a manufacturers' fleet."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"\------ OBAMA: ""Already the Affordable Care Act is helping to reduce the growth of health care costs."""
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,THE FACTS: The jury is still out on whether Obama's health care overhaul will reduce the growth of health care costs.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"It's true that cost increases have eased, but many experts say that's due to the sluggish economy, not to the health care law, whose main provisions are not yet fully in effect."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"\------ OBAMA: ""Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally."""
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"THE FACTS: The seemingly stern admonition that illegal immigrants must go to the back of the line, often heard from the president, doesn't appear to have much practical effect except in the most obvious sense."

2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"Like those living abroad who have applied to come to the U.S. legally, illegal immigrants who qualify for Obama's proposed path to citizenship will surely face long waits to be processed."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"But during that time, they are already in the U.S. and will get to stay, work and travel in the country under their new status as provisional immigrants, while those outside the U.S. simply have to wait."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"Sending illegal immigrants to the ""back of the line"" is something of a distinction without a difference for some legal immigrants who dutifully followed all the rules before coming to the United States."

2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"In other cases, would-be legal immigrants in other countries wait for years to be able to settle in the U.S. Obama is using ""back of the line"" somewhat figuratively, because there are multiple lines depending on the applicant's relationship with family already in the U.S. or with an employer."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"Generally, a foreign-born spouse of a U.S. citizen or someone with needed skills and a job offer will be accepted more quickly than many others."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"But even as a figurative point, his assertion may cloak the fact that people who came to the U.S. illegally and win provisional status have the great advantage over applicants abroad of already being where they all want to go."

2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"With Republicans in control of the House, the chances of a bill to limit the gases blamed for global warming and to create a market for businesses to trade pollution credits are close to zero."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,The Obama administration has already acted to control greenhouse gases through existing law.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,It has boosted fuel-efficiency standards and proposed rules to control heat-trapping emissions from new power plants.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"And while there are still other ways to address climate change without Congress, it's questionable regulation alone can achieve the reductions needed to start curbing global warming."

2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"THE FACTS: That statement may reflect the math behind recent debt, but it doesn't get directly to the cause -- the worst recession since the Depression and its aftereffects."

2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"And during the recession, revenues from both individual and corporate taxes fell markedly."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,The steep increases in debt and the measures that should be taken to ease the burden are central to the debate in Washington.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,But there is no serious move afoot to amend the Constitution to prohibit deficit spending.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"The ability to take on debt has been used by governments worldwide and through U.S. history to shelter people from the ravages of a down economy, wage war and achieve many other ends."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,An effort to amend the Constitution for any purpose faces daunting odds; this would be no exception.
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,"Most state constitutions demand a balanced budget, but states lack some big obligations of the federal government, including national defense."
2456,1,Fact check on Obama's State of the Union address,And Washington's ability to go deeper into debt provides states with at least a minimal safety net in times of high unemployment.

2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,President Obama is suggesting that House Republicans on the issue of gun control appear neither willing to work with him nor inclined to listen to the American public on the issue.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"“The House Republican majority is made up mostly of members who are in sharply gerrymandered districts that are very safely Republican and may not feel compelled to pay attention to broad-based public opinion, because what they're really concerned about is the opinions of their specific Republican constituencies,” the president said in an interview with The New Republic."
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"Obama also said he can get 50 percent of public support for many of his upcoming initiatives, but “I can't get enough votes out of the House of Representatives to actually get something passed."
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,… I think there is still shock on the part of some in the party that I won re-election.” The president said he has a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that date back for generations.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,He said that moving forward on the topic means understanding that the realities of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,He said it's understandable that people are protective of their family traditions when it comes to hunting so “gun-control advocates also need to do “a little more listening than they do sometimes” in the debate.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,The interview appears in the Feb. 11 issue of The New Republic.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,Obama also said one of the biggest factors in the gun-control debate will be how it is shaped by the media.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"“If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you’ll see more of them doing it,” he said."
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"“I think John Boehner genuinely wanted to get a deal done, but it was hard to do in part because his caucus is more conservative probably than most Republican leaders are, and partly because he is vulnerable to attack for compromising Republican principles and working with Obama.” The president argued  that “the more left-leaning media outlets recognize that compromise is not a dirty word” and that party leaders, including Senate Majority Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, are “willing to buck the more absolutist-wing elements in our party to try to get stuff done.” Has Obama himself ever fired a gun?"
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"Yes, he says, he and others shoot skeet frequently at the president's Maryland retreat, Camp David."
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,The president also said much of the challenge in Washington is to make Americans feel that national politics is indeed connected to their day-to-day realities.
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"“And that’s not an unjustifiable view,” he said."
2482,1,Obama suggests Republicans unwilling to compromise in gun control debate,"So everything we do combines both a legislative strategy with a broad-based communications and outreach strategy to get people engaged and involved, so that it’s not Washington over here and the rest of America over there.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."

2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","WASHINGTON -- Progressive senators working to dramatically alter Senate rules were defeated on Thursday, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and his counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), set to announce a series of compromise reforms on the Senate floor that fall far short of the demands."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",The language of the deal was obtained by HuffPost and can be read here and here.
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The pressure from the liberal senators, led by Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley and backed by a major coalition of progressive groups, created the political space for Reid to cut the deal with McConnell, which includes changes to how the Senate operates but leaves a fundamental feature, the silent filibuster, in place."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The deal will address the filibuster on the motion to proceed by changing the amount of debate time that would follow a cloture vote from 30 hours to four, speeding up Senate business and allowing more legislation to reach the floor."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","But the deal still requires Democrats to muster 60 votes to invoke cloture on that motion, despite Reid's earlier suggestion that he would bar a filibuster on that motion entirely."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","An alternate route to get past the motion to proceed will be implemented as a change to the rules, and a filibuster on the motion would be barred if the majority can find eight members of the minority, including the minority leader, to sign a petition."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","But Democrats already have 55 members in their caucus, five short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster, so it's unclear what the purpose of getting three additional Republicans would be."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Under the agreement, the minority party will be able to offer two amendments on each bill, a major concession to Republicans."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","This change is made only as a standing order, not a rules change, and expires at the end of the term."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The new rules will also make it easier for the majority to appoint conferees once a bill has passed, but leaves in place the minority's ability to filibuster that motion once -- meaning that even after the Senate and House have passed a bill, the minority can still mount a filibuster one more time."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",Reid won concessions on district court nominations as well.
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Under the old rules, after a filibuster had been beaten, 30 more hours were required to pass before a nominee could finally be confirmed."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",That delay threatened to tie the chamber in knots.
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",The new rules will only allow two hours to pass after cloture is invoked before a nominee is confirmed.
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The two leaders agreed that they will make some changes in how the Senate carries out filibusters under the existing rules, reminiscent of the handshake agreement last term, which quickly fell apart."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","First, senators who wish to object or threaten a filibuster must actually come to the floor to do so."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","And second, the two leaders will make sure that debate time post-cloture is actually used in debate."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","If senators seeking to slow down business simply put in quorum calls to delay action, the Senate will go live, force votes to produce a quorum, and otherwise work to make sure senators actually show up and debate."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The arrangement between Reid and McConnell means that the majority leader will not resort to his controversial threat, known as the ""nuclear option,"" to change the rules via 51 votes on the first day of the congressional session."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Reid may have been able to achieve greater reforms that way, but several members of his own party were uncomfortable with the precedent it would have set."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","And Reid himself, an institutionalist, wanted a bipartisan deal for the long-term health of the institution."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Reid presented McConnell with two offers -- one bipartisan accord consisting of weaker reforms, and a stronger package Reid was willing to ram through on a partisan vote."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",McConnell chose the bipartisan route.
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Supporters of the deal insist that even without using the ""nuclear option,"" Reid was able to secure tangible changes on the pace and conduct of Senate business."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The deal, said one top Democratic aide, is ""not everything Reid wanted but there are significant changes."

2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Let's face it, if not for 60 then Roe v. Wade might be dead and Social Security would be private accounts."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","But, Reid gets the power to get on bills without having to file cloture."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",That's a big deal.
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Also, post cloture time for non appellate judges will be cut from 30 hours to 2."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","That's huge because now Reid can stack nominations, which forces the Repubs' hands."""
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Added another supportive Democratic Senate aide: ""We are now a more efficient Senate; we'll be able to get on bills without having 60 votes and without having to spend a week to do it."

2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","The compromise is a blow to Merkley, who had been the most outspoken proponent of what he called the ""talking filibuster,"" which would change current rules so that the minority couldn't filibuster a bill by simply objecting and sitting down or leaving the chamber."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal","Once that provision looked to be faded, reformers gravitated toward a proposal from Reid that would flip the onus onto the minority by requiring Republicans to affirmatively come up with 41 votes to sustain a filibuster, rather than requiring Democrats to find 60 to end it."
2484,0,"Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell Reach Filibuster Reform Deal",Reid was only willing to go forward with such a move if McConnell had rejected his offer.
