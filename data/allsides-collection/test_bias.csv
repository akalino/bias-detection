2502,0,Both Sides in Gun Debate Agree: Punish Background-Check Liars,"It is a felony to deliberately provide false information in an effort to buy a gun, and studies financed by the Justice Department show that people who do so are more likely than the average person to commit violent crimes after they are denied a firearm purchase."
2502,0,Both Sides in Gun Debate Agree: Punish Background-Check Liars,"At a meeting Mr. Biden held with gun control advocates on Wednesday, the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns recommended to the administration that it should instruct the Justice Department to investigate those who are denied guns and who have a history that suggests they might commit violence."

2502,0,Both Sides in Gun Debate Agree: Punish Background-Check Liars,"Law enforcement experts note that more prosecutions for background-check failures probably would not have prevented the Connecticut school massacre, because the gunman in that case used firearms purchased legally by his mother."

2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"The news that Vice President Joe Biden would huddle with executives from the National Rifle Association on Thursday came as unwelcome news to many gun control advocates who view the NRA as an organization to be ignored, not invited in."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"But, the meeting is smart politics by Biden -- and the White House more broadly."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"It's a recognition that, to pass something on guns through Congress, they need the NRA either on board or not totally in opposition to the proposal."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,Why?
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,Like them or hate them -- and there are lots of people who feel both ways -- the NRA has proven to be among the best-funded and most effective groups when it comes to swaying the sentiments of members of Congress.
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"And while groups like Mayors Against illegal Guns and the newly-formed Americans for Responsible Solutions are being built to match (or at least approximate) the political power of the NRA, neither group is close to there yet -- and likely won't be for some time, if ever."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"Biden, as he has shown both in cutting the debt ceiling deal of 2011 and the fiscal cliff compromise of 2012, understands how legislation makes and breaks in Congress, and he gets that, at least for now, the NRA is an unchallenged force on Capitol Hill when it comes to gun issues."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"And remember that while the broad sentiment about what gun violence says about our society has shifted since the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., last month, public opinion on specific proposals has changed far less."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"Check out this table built by WaPo polling wunderkind Scott Clement: What those numbers suggest is that, while it may feel like the country's view on guns have changed in some fundamental way that strengthens the hand of those who want more gun control, the data suggests it's a much less clear cut than that."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"And, in a political jump ball, having the NRA signed on to some proposal is almost certainly the difference between a bill becoming a law and it, well, not."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"Now, inviting the NRA to a meeting is very different than getting (or wanting to get) the NRA to sign on to the final product that the Biden task force produces."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"(It seems unlikely that if Biden pushes for an assault weapons ban, for instance, that the NRA would be even close to on board.)"
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"But Biden is smart to meet with the NRA both to a) see if there is a place of mutual interest where the organization could actually be supportive of the proposal from the task force, but also b) to try to tamp down the white-hot rhetoric on both sides at the moment."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,"While ""A"" might be the goal, ""B"" has its merits as a political strategy as well."
2506,0,Why Joe Biden needs the NRA,It's at least in theory more difficult for the NRA to aggressively hate a bill that they were consulted on -- even if it's not a piece of legislation they can support.

2508,1,Bipartisan blows stand between Brennan and post at helm of CIA,Democrats complain that he supported torture against suspected terrorists when he served in the CIA during the George W. Bush administration.
2508,1,Bipartisan blows stand between Brennan and post at helm of CIA,The bipartisan criticism is likely to foreshadow a contentious confirmation battle when Mr. Obama’s nominee to lead the CIA faces the Senate intelligence committee.
2508,1,Bipartisan blows stand between Brennan and post at helm of CIA,"Mr. Obama named Mr. Brennan on Monday to replace David H. Petraeus, the retired four-star general who resigned as CIA chief in November after confessing to an adulterous affair."

Murphy, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington legislative office."
2508,1,Bipartisan blows stand between Brennan and post at helm of CIA,"Until all of those questions are answered, she said, “The Senate should not move forward with his nomination.” In his announcement Monday, Mr. Obama praised the “incredible” work ethic of Mr. Brennan, a 25-year CIA veteran and Arabic-speaking Middle East specialist."

2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,But both candidates must provide answers to serious questions before they can expect confirmation by the Senate.
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,It is a puzzle that Mr. Obama has nominated as defense secretary a person whose views on gay rights are in question at this sensitive time in the Pentagon’s evolution.
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"The military’s odious “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule was finally legislated out of existence in 2011, under the administration’s leadership."
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,But there is a long way to go to ensure that equal rights are institutionalized.
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"While a member of the Senate from Nebraska in 1998, Mr. Hagel criticized the nomination of James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg because he was “openly, aggressively gay.” That was a repugnant reason to oppose anyone for public office."

2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,Mr. Obama hailed him as “the leader that our troops deserve.” Mr. Hagel’s experience as a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War should give him a special rapport with the troops as well as make him an authoritative voice on the measured use of force.

2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,He has also wisely advocated paring the bloated defense budget.
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"Mr. Hagel’s independence and willingness to challenge Republican orthodoxy on Iraq, sanctions on Iran and other issues — both in the Senate and later as an administration adviser — have so alarmed neocons, hard-line pro-Israel interest groups and some Republican senators that they unleashed a dishonest campaign to pre-emptively bury the nomination."
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"It failed, but the confirmation process could be bruising."
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,The opponents are worried that Mr. Hagel will not be sufficiently in lock step with the current Israeli government and cannot be counted on to go to war against Iran over its nuclear program if it comes to that.
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"We are encouraged by what we hear about Mr. Hagel’s preference for a negotiated solution with Iran, his reluctance to go to war, and his support for Israel’s security, for a two-state solution and for reductions in nuclear weapons."
2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"If confirmed, he would have to tackle the hard job of cutting the defense budget and balancing the competing needs of the different services."

2508,0,Nominations for Defense and the C.I.A.,"In his second term, President Obama has an opportunity to put his stamp more firmly on America’s relations with the world."

2518,1,Tax hike deal: Obama's first or GOP's last?,"Mr. Obama, having won the first round by forcing congressional Republicans to accept a tax increase for the first time in 20 years, said the deal set a precedent for agreements on deficit reduction and federal spending."

2518,1,Tax hike deal: Obama's first or GOP's last?,"The agreement “enshrines … a principle into law that will remain in place as long as I am president: The deficit needs to be reduced in a way that’s balanced,” Mr. Obama said."
2518,1,Tax hike deal: Obama's first or GOP's last?,“Everyone pays their fair share.” But many Republicans said the agreement this week gave Mr. Obama all the tax increases he ever will get and that future deals must emphasize spending cuts.
2518,1,Tax hike deal: Obama's first or GOP's last?,"Some said they are willing to force a government shutdown to make their point in negotiations over raising the nation’s borrowing limit, which the president said he no longer will debate."

2518,1,Tax hike deal: Obama's first or GOP's last?,"While the president is hailing it as a deficit-reduction measure, the agreement would boost the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, when compared with a scenario in which Congress did nothing."

2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"WASHINGTON — Furious last-minute negotiations between the White House and the Senate Republican leadership on Monday secured a tentative agreement to allow tax rates to rise on affluent Americans, but not in time for Congress to meet its Dec. 31 deadline for averting automatic tax increases and spending cuts deemed a threat to the economy."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"While the Senate moved toward a vote on legislation to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the House was not going to consider any deal until Tuesday afternoon at the earliest, meaning that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts would go into effect as 2013 began."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"If Congress acts quickly and sends the legislation to President Obama, the economic impact could still be very limited."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Under the agreement, tax rates would jump to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individual incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits would start phasing out on incomes as low as $250,000, a clear win for President Obama, who campaigned on higher taxes for the wealthy."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“Just last month Republicans in Congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans,” Mr. Obama said at a hastily arranged news briefing, with middle-income onlookers cheering behind him."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“Obviously, the agreement that’s currently being discussed would raise those rates and raise them permanently.” Democrats also secured a full year’s extension of unemployment insurance without strings attached and without offsetting spending cuts, a $30 billion cost."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"As negotiators tied up the last points of dispute, officials said that the two top Democrats on Capitol Hill — Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California — had signed off on the agreement."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"In an effort to win over other Democrats uneasy with the proposal, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had bargained directly with Republican leaders, traveled to the Capitol on Monday night for a 90-minute meeting with his former Senate colleagues."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“I feel very, very good,” Mr. Biden said after the meeting."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“I think we’ll get a very good vote.” In one final piece of the puzzle, negotiators agreed to put off $110 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs for two months while broader deficit reduction talks continue."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Those cuts begin to go into force on Wednesday, and that deadline, too, might be missed before Congress approves the legislation."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"To secure votes, Mr. Reid also told Democrats the legislation would cancel a pending congressional pay raise — putting opponents in the politically difficult position of supporting a raise — and extend an expiring dairy policy that would have seen the price of milk double in some parts of the country."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Anticipating Senate approval of the deal, Speaker John A. Boehner late Monday said the House would “honor its commitment to consider the Senate agreement if it is passed."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members — and the American people — have been able to review the legislation.” The nature of the deal ensured that the running war between the White House and Congressional Republicans on spending and taxes would continue at least until the spring.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner formally notified Congress that the government reached its statutory borrowing limit on New Year’s Eve.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Through some creative accounting tricks, the Treasury Department can put off action for perhaps two months, but Congress must act to keep the government from defaulting just when the “pause” on pending cuts is up."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Then in late March, a law financing the government expires."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,And the new deal does nothing to address the big issues that Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner hoped to deal with in their failed “grand bargain” talks two weeks ago: booming entitlement spending and a tax code so complex that few defend it anymore.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Though the tentative deal had a chance of success if put to a vote, it landed with a thud on Capitol Hill."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,Republicans accused the White House of “moving the goal posts” by demanding still more tax increases to help shut off across-the-board spending cuts beyond the two-month pause.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,Democrats were incredulous that the president had ultimately agreed to around $600 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years when even Mr. Boehner had promised $800 billion.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,But the White House said it had also won concessions on unemployment insurance and the inheritance tax among other wins.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Still, Democrats openly worried that if Mr. Obama could not drive a harder bargain when he holds most of the cards, he will give up still more Democratic priorities in the coming weeks, when hard deadlines will raise the prospects of a government default first, then a government shutdown."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"In both instances, conservative Republicans are more willing to breach the deadlines than in this case, when conservatives cringed at the prospects of huge tax increases."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“I just don’t think Obama’s negotiated very well,” said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"But as night fell on New Year’s Eve, senators seemed worn down and resigned."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“Everybody by this time is angry, but sooner or later this has to be resolved,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Even House Republicans signaled that enough of them, in combination with Democrats, could most likely pass the legislation, just weeks after Republicans shot down Mr. Boehner’s proposal to raise taxes only on incomes over $1 million."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“I don’t want to say where I am until I read the legislation, but it is certainly better than the alternative,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania."

2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"“No deal is the worse deal,” said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, rejecting the assertions of liberal colleagues that no deal would be better than what they would see as a bad deal."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"However, new wrenches were gumming up the machinery."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Democrats put out late word that Republicans wanted the threshold at which inherited estates would be taxed to be indexed to inflation, a nonstarter for them."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,Republicans said they needed to see what cuts would pay for the $24 billion needed to put off across-the-board spending cuts.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"But with Republicans and Democrats grumbling, it was clear that a deal hashed out through intense talks between Mr. Biden and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had given both sides provisions to cheer and to jeer."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Under the deal, tax rates on dividends and capital gains would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent, on income over $400,000 for single people and $450,000 for couples."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"The deal would reinstate provisions to tax law, ended by the Bush tax cuts of 2001, that phase out personal exemptions and deductions for the affluent."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Those phaseouts, under the agreement, would begin at $250,000 for single people and $300,000 for couples."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"The estate tax would also rise, but considerably less than Democrats had wanted."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"The value of estates over $5 million would be taxed at 40 percent, up from 35 percent."
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,Democrats had wanted a 45 percent rate on inheritances over $3.5 million.
2521,0,2 Sides in Talks Inch Closer but No Fiscal Deal on Final Day,"Under the deal, the new rates on income, investment and inheritances would be permanent, as would a provision to stop the alternative minimum tax from hitting middle-class families."

Geithner, adding to the building tension over how to handle a year-end pileup of threatened tax increases and spending cuts, formally notified Congress on Wednesday that the government would hit its statutory borrowing limit on Monday, raising anew the threat of a federal default as the two parties remained in a standoff."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,Mr. Geithner wrote that he would take “extraordinary measures” to keep the government afloat but said that with so much uncertainty over the shape of the tax code and future government spending he did not know how long the Treasury could shuffle accounts before the government could no longer pay its creditors.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"For months, President Obama, members of Congress of both parties and top economists have warned that the nation’s fragile economy could be swept back into recession if the two parties did not come to a post-election compromise on January’s combination of tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"Yet with days left before the fiscal punch lands, both sides are exhibiting little sense of urgency, and new public statements Wednesday appeared to be designed more to ensure the other side is blamed rather than to foster progress toward a deal."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"After a high-level telephone conference call, House Republican leaders called on the Senate to act but opened the door to bringing to the House floor any last-minute legislation the Senate could produce."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"“The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass, but the Senate first must act,” said the statement issued on behalf of Speaker John A. Boehner and his three top lieutenants."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"But Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, instead called on House Republicans to pass an existing Senate measure that would prevent tax increases on household income up to $250,000."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"“The Senate has already rejected House Republicans’ Tea Party bills, and no further legislation can move through the Senate until Republicans drop their knee-jerk obstruction,” he said in a statement."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,Senators will return to the Capitol on Thursday evening with nothing yet to consider.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,The series of votes waiting for them are unrelated to the fiscal deadline.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"The House will be gaveled into session at 2 p.m., but since Mr. Boehner has not called the members back to Washington, it will most likely be gaveled back into recess shortly thereafter."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"The shift to the Senate has focused new attention on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a deal-making veteran."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,Democrats say they need assurances from Mr. McConnell that he will not use procedural tactics to delay any potential bill for an interim solution to avert the fiscal crisis.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"But Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said no one from the White House or from Mr. Reid’s office has reached out to begin negotiations."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"Democrats say that Mr. McConnell knows full well what they are proposing: the same Senate bill that passed in July extending all the expiring Bush-era income tax cuts on incomes below $250,000, setting the tax rate on dividends and capital gains at 20 percent, and stopping the alternative minimum tax from rising to hit more middle class taxpayers."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"Onto that, Democrats would like to add an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a delay in across-the-board spending cuts while negotiations on a broader deficit reduction plan slips into next year."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,Democrats now suggest that Republicans are content to wait until after the January deadline.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"On Jan. 3, Mr. Boehner is likely to be re-elected speaker for the 113th Congress."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"After that roll call, he may feel less pressure from his right flank against a deal."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"For its part, the Senate may simply be out of time."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"Without unanimous agreement, Mr. Reid would have to take procedural steps to begin considering a bill."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,He could then be forced to press for another vote to cut off debate before final passage.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"If forced to jump through those hoops, the 112th Congress could expire before final votes could be cast."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"“I think there’s some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January, which technically means you’re going over the cliff,” Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNBC on Wednesday."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,Lawmakers from both parties say Mr. McConnell could be the key to a resolution.
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"He has played the role of adjudicator for Congressional Republicans before, during last year’s fight over a payroll tax extension and the battle between Democrats and Republicans over how, or if, to pay for an emergency disaster financing bill."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"With days to spare, Mr. McConnell must decide whether to allow on the Senate floor the Democrats’ bill to extend expiring tax cuts."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"If passed without a filibuster, that legislation could force the House speaker’s hand and quiet his raucous Republican conference."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"Or Mr. McConnell, who is up for re-election in 2014 and would like to avoid a primary fight, could stand back quietly and hope that Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama somehow manage to put together a deal that saves him the trouble."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"If Mr. McConnell cannot come to the rescue, there is another hope: Starbucks."
2525,0,Senators to Return With 5 Days Left and No Clear Fiscal Path,"Howard Schultz, the company’s chief executive officer, asked baristas who work in Washington-area Starbucks to scrawl “Come Together” on coffee cups for the rest of the week to generate enthusiasm for a compromise."

2529,1,NRA chief: Enforce the existing gun laws LaPier,"Mr. LaPierre has tapped former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, Arkansas Republican, to head a group tasked with developing a model safety plan that local school systems throughout the country can use."

2529,1,NRA chief: Enforce the existing gun laws LaPier,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said on “Meet the Press” that he didn’t know whether there is a way to stop acts of violence if a person is determined, and that he does not favor reinstating a ban on assault weapons, as Sen.

2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"\-- Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, talking to NBC News."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,The Obama Democrats are today furious at the opposition of Republicans that ended the bid of presidential favorite U.N.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Ambassador Susan Rice to replace outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,[pullquote] But this would be sort of like being upset at the bear that trashed your campsite in search of your food.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"The bear was just being a bear, like Lindsey Graham and John McCain were just being themselves."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Bears like peanut butter and Republican senators like to bedevil controversial Democratic appointees.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,The real question is who forgot to seal up the cooler and hang the rest of the chow from a tree branch.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Who enticed the bears into camp?
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Rice, a friend and confidante of President Obama, gave the answer on Thursday night in an interview with NBC’s Brian Williams."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,It was Clinton herself that set in motion what would become the shambles of Rice’s once-inevitable march into the top cabinet slot for the second Obama term.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,It was a round of Sunday show interviews in the wake of the Sept. 11 raid by Islamist militiamen in Libya that ultimately doomed Rice’s chance to have the top job.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Rice, no doubt looking for the chance to burnish her profile on big issues, sallied forth the following Sunday to lay out the administration talking points that the deadly attack was a spontaneous result of riots over a YouTube video offensive to Muslims."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"That wasn’t true, as some in the administration already knew."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Not only was the attack not spontaneous, but there were no riots."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,It was a premeditated strike that resulted in a battle that raged off and on for many hours.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Questions have mounted about why security was inadequate despite rising warnings about radicals in the new Islamist state, why the president opted not to mount a rescue mission and the overall wisdom of helping install Islamist governments in the region."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Obama foes have debated whether Rice knowingly misled the public or was simply sticking to the talking points.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Was she dissembling or simply repeat what she had been told.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"This now becomes a matter of no significance because we’ll never really know and Obama looks likely to install his friend as his National Security Adviser, a position that requires no congressional approval."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"But whatever led Rice to say what she said, we know that Clinton herself wisely avoided the trap of talking about what she likely knew would end up being a serious foreign policy scandal."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Madame Secretary opted to let the woman who was itching to replace her go ahead and take the limelight.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Clinton , who became the clear frontrunner for the 2016 presidential election the day after this year’s election, sidestepped what she knew, or had reason to know, would be a disaster."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Did she disagree with the White House communications strategy of emphasizing the spontaneity of the raid?
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Not likely since she would herself publicly emphasize the non-existent riots and the video in public remarks.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,More likely she knew that she would have difficulty answering the other questions.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Her agency had denied requests for additional security despite prior attacks and warnings from the doomed ambassador.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"She herself likely knew what the president knew, and when he knew it, about the raid and why Obama chose not to send reinforcements to the consulate."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,Rice’s rueful explanation about Clinton sidestepping the Sunday shows makes it clear she knows who lured the bears into camp.
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Rice, a stalwart retainer of the House of Obama, knows that Clinton, the matriarch of the rival Democratic clan, let the ambitious ambassador take the fall."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Not only did it shield Clinton but it also helped set up the nomination of her former colleague and ally, Sen. John Kerry."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Having survived the first several rounds of the Benghazi debacle, Clinton faces her final and greatest test: testimony before fuming House Republicans."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Clinton has been summoned to testify on Thursday about the raid, but her spokeswoman says it’s not certain that she will appear."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Clinton is no stranger to hostile questioning in testimony and depositions tracing all the way back to her time as first lady of Arkansas, so she is well equipped on how to evade unpleasant questions."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"“I do not recall,” being a useful phrase."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Although Clinton would not like leave office on that note, neither would she like to leave office being held in contempt of Congress for refusing to appear."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"The latter may be a more appealing option, though, since she could say her testifying could endanger national security because of partisan attacks, etc."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"Clinton can hardly leave her post before a replacement is confirmed, so her goal is to keep the Benghazi business from damaging her valedictory weeks at Foggy Bottom."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"It’s a tricky task, but as Rice learned and Obama has been taught again, Clinton is not someone to be underestimated."
2533,1,Clinton Looking for Clean Getaway on Benghazi,"And Now, A Word From Charles “The idea that the readout that this was a ‘frank discussion’ [between Speaker John Boehner and President Obama]: Look, frank is a word they use in diplomacy."

2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"“The cases are moving fast, and the country is as well.” There has indeed been a rapid shift in public opinion, with a majority of Americans now saying they support same-sex marriage."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"With last month’s elections, nine states and the District of Columbia now allow such unions."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Still, the Supreme Court’s move came just eight years after Massachusetts became the first state to permit gay and lesbian couples to marry and just four years after voters in California rejected a ruling of their Supreme Court allowing same-sex marriages there."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"The cautious move for the justices would have been to hear just one of the cases they were asked to consider, the one posing the relatively modest question of whether the federal government can discriminate against same-sex couples married in the places that allow such unions."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"But the court went big on Friday, also taking the case from California filed by Theodore B. Olson and David Boies."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Their case seeks to establish a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in the remaining states, almost all of which have laws or constitutional provisions prohibiting it."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"“We are now literally within months,” Mr. Boies said Friday, “of getting a final resolution of this case that began three and a half years ago.” The speed with which the court is moving has some gay rights advocates bracing for a split decision."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"The court could strike down the federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, saying that the meaning of marriage is a matter for the states to decide."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"At the same time, it could reject the idea that the Constitution requires states to allow same-sex marriage, saying that the meaning of marriage is a matter for the states to decide."

2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"“I’m ecstatic,” said Brian S. Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"“Taking both cases at the same time exposes the hypocrisy on the other side.” It is entirely possible, then, that the votes to grant review in the California case came from the court’s more conservative justices."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"They may have calculated that they had a shot at capturing the decisive vote of the member of the court at its ideological center, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, at least in the California case."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"But while the court is moving fast, it has left itself plenty of offramps."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Officials in California refused to defend Proposition 8, the voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage in the state, or to appeal the lower-court decisions invalidating it."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,They left those tasks to proponents of the initiative.
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"On Friday, the justices directed the parties to address the issue of whether the proponents of banning same-sex marriage had suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to appeal."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"If the answer is no, the trial court decision requiring the state to allow same-sex marriage would stand, but its sweep in the short term could be limited to two California counties or perhaps even to just the couples who brought the case."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,The justices could also affirm a California-only rationale relied on by the appeals court.
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,That court said Proposition 8 must fall because voters had withdrawn a constitutional right from gay men and lesbians.
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Whether the establishment of such a right was required by the Constitution in the first place, it said, was a question for another day."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Finally, the justices could pursue what Kenji Yoshino, a law professor at New York University, calls the “eight-state solution,” one that would affect California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Those states give gay and lesbian couples all the benefits and burdens of marriage but withhold the name “marriage.” That distinction, the court could rule, violates equal protection principles."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"Such a ruling, though, could have “perverse effects,” Professor Yoshino says."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"States prepared to enact laws allowing gay and lesbian couples to join in civil unions — marriages in everything but name — might hesitate, for fear of being forced by the courts to adopt same-sex marriage if they do."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"But the eight-state solution would also be unlikely to give rise to the sort of reaction that imposing same-sex marriage on, say, Mississippi would."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"However the court rules in the California case, its very decision to consider it is a change from the caution of an earlier era."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"In private correspondence in 1957, Justice Felix Frankfurter said the court was doing all it could to avoid hearing cases that would require giving the nation an answer about whether bans on interracial marriage — anti-miscegenation laws, in the parlance of the day — were constitutional."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"“We twice shunted it away,” Justice Frankfurter wrote to Judge Learned Hand, “and I pray we will be able to do it again without being too brazenly evasive.” Judge Hand responded that “I don’t see how you lads can duck it.” But Justice Frankfurter was unpersuaded."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"“I shall work, within the limits of judicial decency,” he wrote, “to put off decision on miscegenation as long as I can.” The Supreme Court did not strike down laws banning interracial marriage until 1967, in Loving v. Virginia, when 16 states still had them on the books."
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,That was almost two decades after the California Supreme Court in 1948 struck down a law making illegal “all marriages of white persons with Negroes” in Perez v. Sharp.
2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,"It has been just four years since the California Supreme Court, citing Perez, struck down two state laws limiting marriage to a man and a woman."

2552,0,Same-Sex Issue Pushes Justices Into Overdrive,She said she supported allowing “our gay and lesbian neighbors” to marry.

2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"Republican leaders struggled Tuesday to contain the backlash from conservatives over the GOP’s offer of $800 billion in tax increases to head off the “fiscal cliff” — a move that didn’t impress the White House, even as it spawned a rebellion on the right."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,Conservative lawmakers and interest groups said House Speaker John A. Boehner’s offer abandoned core Republican principles and earned no credit from a White House that has insisted on even bigger tax increases and balked at major spending cuts.
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"“This isn’t rocket science,” said Sen. Jim DeMint, South Carolina Republican."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"“Everyone knows that when you take money out of the economy, it destroys jobs, and everyone knows that when you give politicians more money, they spend it.” The conservative Heritage Foundation also dismissed the Republican plan, saying it fails Mr. Boehner’s own test of seriousness because it doesn’t do enough to curtail entitlement spending."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"Even as he faces resistance on higher taxes, Mr. Boehner pivoted Tuesday, saying after a bipartisan meeting with House Republican leaders and a handful of governors that spending cuts are crucial to the deal."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"“Yesterday, Republicans made a good-faith offer to avert the fiscal cliff that includes significant spending cuts and new revenue without raising tax rates on small businesses and costing jobs,” Mr. Boehner said."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"“I will continue to urge governors of both parties to talk to small-business men and women in their states about the impact it will have on small businesses if Washington raises their tax rates, as President Obama is demanding, rather than cutting spending and reforming entitlement programs.” Led by Mr. Boehner, the House’s leadership sent a $2.2 trillion proposal to the White House on Monday that included $900 billion in cuts to entitlement programs and $300 billion in lower discretionary spending, but also promised $800 billion more in taxes, which aides said would come from eliminating deductions and loopholes claimed by the wealthy."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"The White House rejected the proposal, saying it doesn’t believe the Republican numbers add up and noting Mr. Obama will insist that the wealthy pay a higher income tax rate, rather than just have loopholes closed."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"“Unfortunately, the speaker’s proposal right now is still out of balance,” Mr. Obama said Tuesday in a Bloomberg Television interview."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"“You know, he talks, for example, about $800 billion worth of revenues, but he says he’s going to do that by lowering rates."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"And when you look at the math, it doesn’t work.” Republicans and Democrats are trying to avoid the fiscal cliff — the across-the-board tax increases and $110 billion in automatic spending cuts that will kick in at the beginning of next year if lawmakers can’t agree on a budget deal."
2559,1,Boehner plan is criticized by both sides,"Going over the cliff, many economists predict, would plunge the nation into a short, sharp recession — but over the long haul, the spending cuts and tax increases would leave the federal government in better fiscal and economic shape, the Congressional Budget Office says."

2584,1,Report: Obama Was Briefed on Benghazi Terrorism Connection Days Before Susan Rice's Public Denials,"Most were believed to be from a local Libyan militia group called Ansar al-Sharia that is sympathetic to al-Qaida, the official said, while a handful of others was linked to a direct al-Qaida affiliate in North Africa known as AQIM."
2584,1,Report: Obama Was Briefed on Benghazi Terrorism Connection Days Before Susan Rice's Public Denials,"Those briefings also raised the possibility that the attackers may have been inspired both by spontaneous protests across the globe on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and by a desire to seek vengeance for the U.S. killing last summer of a Libyan-born leader of al-Qaida named Abu Yaya al-Libi, the officials said, speaking only on condition of anonymity because they were discussing intelligence matters."

2584,1,Report: Obama Was Briefed on Benghazi Terrorism Connection Days Before Susan Rice's Public Denials,"U.S. intelligence officials said Friday, however, the assessment that the tragedy was an attack by extremists with al-Qaida links was well defined within 48 to 72 hours."

2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,It calls for $1.6 trillion in new revenues — twice the sum that Speaker John A. Boehner was willing to consider back then.
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"“The president has put forward a very specific plan that will be what he brings to the table when he sits down with Congressional leaders,” Mr. Carney told reporters at his daily White House briefing."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"The $4 trillion, 10-year plan includes the commitment to $1.1 trillion in spending cuts that Mr. Obama and Congress have already agreed to, he added, as well as additional spending cuts that include $340 billion in savings from Medicare and Medicaid."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"And, Mr. Carney said, Mr. Obama “insists as the essence of balance that revenue be included — $1.6 trillion in revenue.” The president’s initial bargaining posture reflects the leverage he gained, by both parties’ reckoning, through his own re-election and the additional seats in Congress that his party won last week."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,The newly elected candidates will not be part of the lame-duck Congress that opened this week.
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"Mr. Boehner and other Republicans are nonetheless chastened by their parties’ losses and have signaled a new openness to raising revenues as part of an accord that also reduces long-term spending for the costly entitlement benefit programs, chiefly Medicare and Medicaid."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"Mr. Carney suggested, as other White House officials have, that Mr. Obama’s victory amounted to a mandate for a “balanced” deficit reduction plan that includes higher taxes from the wealthy since the president campaigned on that issue."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"“One of the useful things about this past year and the election is that these matters that the president and Congress will be deciding in the coming days and weeks and months were front and center during the campaign season,” he said."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,Yet Mr. Carney followed by noting the conciliatory tone that Mr. Obama struck in his post-election comments late last week.
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"“He also said very clearly that he is not wedded to every aspect of his plan, and that he understands that in order to reach an agreement, everyone needs to compromise, and that compromise should not be a dirty word in Washington,” Mr. Carney said."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"But the president, in his White House meeting with union leaders and the heads of various progressive groups, emphasized instead how tough he will be in the coming budget talks."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"Throughout his first term, Mr. Obama’s liberal base has complained that he is too quick to compromise, and leaders went to the White House primed to stiffen his spine."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"“We are very, very committed so that the middle class and workers don’t end up paying the tab for a party we didn’t get to go to, and the president is committed to that as well,” said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., as he left the White House."
2592,0,Obama Vows Firm Stance on Deficit-Reduction Plan,"In an interview later, Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, said of the hourlong session, “There was strong agreement that we have to pass the extension of the middle-class tax cuts, and we’re hoping that the extreme right wing in the Congress is willing to listen to the mandate of the people and work with the president to have the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.”"

2601,1,Obama wins second term,"President Obama won re-election to the White House on Tuesday night, holding together enough of his hope-and-change coalition to repeat his historic 2008 election and surviving a sluggish economy and a fractured electorate that desired a change but failed to find Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney a credible alternative."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"His renewed lease on the White House gives him a chance to see his health care law take full effect in 2014, another opportunity to push for the tax increases he declared to be part of his campaign mandate, and pressure to deliver on his promise of immigration reform."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come,” a ebullient president said at his victory rally in Chicago as the clock neared 2 a.m. on the East Coast."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Mr. Obama painted his re-election as the latest chapter in America’s 200-year-old quest “of perfecting our union” and vowed to turn his attention to trying to forge bipartisan compromises on immigration, energy and the deficit."

2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever.” He and Mr. Romney combined to spend about $2 billion in their fight for the White House, essentially killing the public campaign financing system."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,That figure doesn’t include the hundreds of millions spent by congressional candidates or outside groups.
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"The presidential race was called about 11:15 EST, just minutes after West Coast states closed their polls and after Ohio was called for Mr. Obama, eliminating Mr. Romney’s path to victory."

2601,1,Obama wins second term,Mr. Obama becomes only the second president in history to win a second term with fewer Electoral College votes than his first win — meaning he returns to the White House with a limited mandate.
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"He also will be facing a divided Congress, where Republicans kept control of the House and Democrats maintained their majority in the Senate."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said the split results meant voters backed the GOP’s vision."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“We offered solutions, and the American people want solutions, and tonight they responded by renewing our Republican House majority,” Mr. Boehner said at a victory party."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"He also took aim at Mr. Obama’s claim that his re-election would clear the path for tax increases on the wealthy, with the speaker saying flatly “there’s no mandate for raising taxes.” But with Democrats on the brink of not only holding the Senate but possibly expanding their majority, Mr. Boehner and his GOP troops remain isolated."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, urged the GOP to work with him."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“Now that the election is over, it’s time to put politics aside and work together to find solutions,” Mr. Reid said."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“The strategy of obstruction, gridlock and delay was soundly rejected by the American people."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Now, they are looking to us for solutions.” But voters, in returning a Democrat to the White House, Democrats to a majority in the Senate and Republicans to control of the House, appeared to be asking for a do-over after two years of gridlock in the least productive Congress since records began to be kept after World War II."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Mr. Obama eked out his popular-vote victory with a late-campaign surge that appeared powered in part by his response to Hurricane Sandy, which polls showed appeared to sway some late support his way."

2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray the president be successful in guiding our nation.” Mr. Obama won by taking advantage of what amounted to a never-ending campaign that picked up right after he won office in 2008."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"That meant he took a phenomenal “ground game” of volunteers and local campaign offices into Tuesday’s election, and it appeared to pay off across the country, where he kept states such as North Carolina and Virginia close, and easily outdistanced Mr. Romney in states such as Pennsylvania, denying the Republican a chance to expand the playing field."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“Mitt Romney has done a better job with their ground game than [Republican nominee John] McCain did in ‘08, but they’ve generally given very short shrift to their ground game, really focusing on their ground game only in the last few weeks,” said Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“We’ve had a very strong ground game since 2007, and I think that’s bearing fruit tonight.” In Congress, voters again opted for division."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"That Senate result marks a major win for Democrats and a huge disappointment for Republicans, who earlier this year had eyed as many as a half-dozen pickups which would have given them a majority."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,The divided Congress is likely to make life difficult for all sides.
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“It’s going to be complicated under any scenario,” said Darrell M. West, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"“Neither side is going to want to do things that’s going to help the other.” In the nation’s statehouses, the GOP said it netted at least one governorship, giving them 30 of the country’s 50 chief executives."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Exit polls showed about 60 percent of voters rated the economy as the top issue, though only about 40 percent said they saw progress on that front."

2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Mr. Obama, 51, a former U.S. senator who makes his home in Chicago, made history in 2008 by becoming the first black man to win the White House."

2601,1,Obama wins second term,"He had major legislative accomplishments during his first two years: With huge majorities in Congress, Democrats passed the economic stimulus, new financial market regulations and the health care reform that has become Mr. Obama’s signature achievement."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"But a voter backlash in 2010, which Mr. Obama deemed a “shellacking,” gave the GOP control of the House, curbed Democrats’ majority in the Senate and left conservatives pushing for deep spending cuts to try to contain the red ink that spilled across government balance sheets."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"The country ran trillion-dollar deficits all four years Mr. Obama was in office, and the overall national debt topped $16 trillion."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Amid that playing field, Mr. Romney, 65, a former one-term governor of Massachusetts who made his personal fortune at the helm of Bain Capital, vowed to bring bipartisanship and a businessman’s can-do know-how to Washington."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"He also promised big ideas, including an overhaul of Medicare and Medicaid to try to cap the rising costs of entitlements, which threaten to crowd out all other federal spending in coming decades."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Mr. Romney underscored his commitment by picking as his running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, whose budget plans have deeply divided Congress over the past two years."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,But Mr. Ryan at least was able to say that his fellow Republicans in the House passed a budget.
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Not so for the Senate, where Democrats have failed for three straight years to pass a blueprint for spending."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,Passing a budget is just one of the challenges awaiting the election victors.
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"The next Congress will be sworn in on Jan. 3, and Mr. Obama retakes the oath of office Jan. 20."

2601,1,Obama wins second term,"With the election so narrowly decided, the winner was unlikely to carry much of a mandate into the next term."
2601,1,Obama wins second term,"Combined with a split Congress, that meant there was little chance of easy answers to the items stacked up on the agenda."

2616,1,Obama auto-bailout strategy running on fumes in Ohio,"DAYTON, Ohio — The Obama campaign is counting on the auto-industry bailout to carry the president to a victory in Ohio, but it ultimately may hold little sway with voters across the state who are still out of work and struggling to stay solvent."

2616,1,Obama auto-bailout strategy running on fumes in Ohio,"Contrary to what Mr. Obama has said, Mr. Romney never proposed the liquidation of GM or Chrysler."

2619,0,Chambliss slams W.H. for Libya emails,A senior senator slammed the Obama administration on Wednesday and called for additional hearings on Libya after emails surfaced showing that White House officials knew within hours that an Islamic militant group was taking responsibility for the attacks on the Benghazi-based U.S. Consulate there.
2619,0,Chambliss slams W.H. for Libya emails,"“I don’t know what the White House’s problem has been through this whole thing,” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on Fox News Channel’s”Fox & Friends.” “Here’s what really concerns me: You’ve got four Americans dead, you’ve got an ambassador, a very important person in any administration, dead — and you don’t have the president out there getting briefed on a regular basis, you don’t have the president informing the public about what happened to four key Americans.” Story Continued Below The Georgia Republican’s comments came a day after a report from Reuters indicated that White House and State Department officials “were advised two hours after attackers assaulted the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi on Sept. 11 that an Islamic militant group had claimed credit for the attack,” according to official emails."
2619,0,Chambliss slams W.H. for Libya emails,"The question of when the Obama administration acknowledged that the attacks in Benghazi resulted from terrorism, rather than from “spontaneous” protests in response to an anti-Islam video, has been a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats for weeks, hitting a boiling point during the second presidential debate."
2619,0,Chambliss slams W.H. for Libya emails,"When asked whether he would pursue hearings on Libya as vice chairman of the select committee, Chambliss said, “we are,” adding that he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who chairs the committee, have had “a couple of conversations about this.” “I told her, I said I think we need to have an open hearing — which is unusual for us, most of ours are classified — but we need to have an open hearing, we need to get the intelligence officials in and just let them lay it out there,” Chambliss said."
2619,0,Chambliss slams W.H. for Libya emails,"“This thing is getting more and more traction, more and more legs, and it’s getting uglier every day."
2619,0,Chambliss slams W.H. for Libya emails,"And I think the thing we need to do is be honest with the American people — and say, here’s what we knew, here’s when we knew it, here’s what the president knew and when the president knew it.” Three members of the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a letter to President Barack Obama Wednesday in the wake of the report, writing that “the American people deserve answers” to myriad questions surrounding the Benghazi attacks, and the administration’s response in the days and weeks after the Sept. 11 violence in Libya."

2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","Although the national tracking polls show, on average, a race that is about tied, they would have conveyed the impression of a four-point lead for Mr. Romney if weighted based on how often they were cited in news accounts."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite",The simplest and best defense against this is merely to take the average of the polls.
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","Even averaging methods can conceal a fair amount of intrinsic uncertainty, however."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","The nine national polls included in the RealClearPolitics average as of Sunday evening, for instance, contained about 12,000 interviews between them."

2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","First, some of the “noise” in polling is predictable, since some polling firms consistently show results that are more favorable for one or the other candidate."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","In the cases in which the pattern is most consistent, we correct for this by means of our house effects adjustment."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","Second, we seek to use state polling data and national polling data in a holistic way."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","It might seem, if you are looking at the state polls and the national polls in a very literal-minded way, that Mr. Obama is quite likely to win the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote."

2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","To regard the probability as being substantially higher than that — taking the RealClearPolitics state and national polling averages might imply a 20 percent probability of a split outcome, for instance — may be to overestimate the degree of precision in both state and national polling averages."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","What appears to be a tied race in national polls, as I mentioned, could fairly easily be a two-point lead for Mr. Obama just based on statistical variance alone, in which case there would be no appreciable difference between the national polls and the polls in the tipping-point states."
2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite","By the same calculation, of course, the national polls could also be consistent with a two-point lead for Mr. Romney."

2620,0,"Oct. 21: Uncertainty Clouds Polling, but Obama Remains Electoral College Favorite",Be wary of analyses that suggest that one candidate is surging or declining by an especially large amount in one or two particular states in a way that diverges from the overall trend in the race.

2626,0,Rival Campaigns Intently Pursue Votes of Women,"Shortly after the combative presidential debate on Tuesday, Mitt Romney’s campaign began running a striking new commercial that uses a former Obama supporter to contest the notion that Mr. Romney’s positions on abortion and contraception are “extreme.” Before dawn Wednesday, Democrats had taken to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and television to ridicule Mr. Romney’s debate-night statement that he had collected “binders full of women” when he was a new governor in Massachusetts seeking “qualified” female appointees for his administration."
2626,0,Rival Campaigns Intently Pursue Votes of Women,"And on the campaign trail and on the air, the candidates and their allies argued intensely all day over who would do more to help women."

2626,0,Rival Campaigns Intently Pursue Votes of Women,"Their goal, Romney aides said, is to keep Mr. Obama’s lead among women, which in many polls has been in double digits, down to the low single digits."

2626,0,Rival Campaigns Intently Pursue Votes of Women,"Through polling and focus groups, the Romney campaign has found that while undecided women said they were concerned primarily about economic issues, they were troubled by whether Mr. Romney’s positions on issues like abortion and contraception were too unyielding."
2626,0,Rival Campaigns Intently Pursue Votes of Women,"Mr. Romney, who while running for governor in 2002 said he would govern as a supporter of abortion rights but subsequently came to shift his position, now opposes abortion except in cases of rape and incest."

2639,0,In Search of Answers From Mr. Romney,They did not get it on Monday.
2639,0,In Search of Answers From Mr. Romney,"Mr. Obama should respond, forcefully, to Mr. Romney on these issues, even before their next debate on Oct. 16, which will include issues of foreign affairs."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"On Columbus Day, Mitt Romney went to the Virginia Military Institute to outline a starkly different foreign policy vision from President Obama’s approach of apologizing for America, ignoring Islamism, mistreating our allies and embracing our enemies."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,It came none too soon.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,The Syrian war has spilled across the border of a NATO ally and there are new indications the rebellion is drifting toward the influence of radical jihadists.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"In our own hemisphere, the anti-US strongman with whom Obama shared a brother handshake in public, Hugo Chavez, just claimed a new mandate to advance his anti-American cause."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"The Iranian regime—the chief opponent of a modern, civilized order in the Middle East -- is lurching toward a nuclear weapons capability."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"And then there is Libya, where a terrorist attack that killed US ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans has led not to reprisals and serious action, but an administration lying to the American people about national security to a degree not seen since the Vietnam era."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"Mitt Romney laid out an alternative that would be stingy with lives of American servicemen, but willing to use American statecraft and power when our interests are clearly on the line."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"Where Obama has done nothing to help Syrian rebels for want of a permission slip from the UN, Romney would “identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad’s tanks, helicopters and fighter jets.” Where Obama and his aides have lied to the American people about the terrorist attack in Libya, Romney vowed to “pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans,” noting that the attack was work of “terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others.” Where Obama turned his back on pro-freedom protestors and sought to sweet talk the deadly Iranian regime out of its nuclear aspirations, Romney promised to position the military force necessary—and to stop the looming defense cuts that would eviscerate that military—in order to convince Tehran that there will be consequences to aggression."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"Outlining his approach to the world at large, Romney noted “I believe that if America does not lead, others will--others who do not share our interests and our values--and the world will grow darker.” This commitment to smart internationalism differentiates Romney from an Obama administration that has been asleep at the wheel as revolutions have swept the Middle East, stunned that the president’s repeated apologies for past American conduct and deep bow to the Saudi king somehow did not fix America’s problems in the region."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,But Romney also made clear he is no neo-conservative.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,His plan for Syria rejects the no-fly zone approach to everything advocated by Republicans John McCain and Lindsay Graham.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"So instead of an open-ended military commitment Americans want least right now, the Romney plan for Syria would influence the future political outcome away from radical Islamists—what really matters most for the future government that will inherit Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"Overall, the would-be Romney doctrine has a focus on political outcomes abroad—what comes after a war or revolution—that has been missing from recent administrations of both parties."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"The one matter conspicuously absent from Romney’s speech was a comprehensive approach to China, which he mentioned only once."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"China’s unelected government sits atop a kleptocracy that systematically steals American intellectual property and trade secrets, wages a relentless cyber war on the United States, and is undertaking a massive military buildup aimed at pushing the US out of the Western Pacific."
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,But at least Romney has called for what could be the most important tool in containing an increasingly aggressive China—a strong military centered around a restored US Navy.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,Beijing will take note of that more than hopeful statements about cooperation from Obama’s diplomats.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,President John Quincy Adams famously said that America “does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.”  So too can we now assume a Romney presidency would avoid foreign adventures.
2639,1,Romney offers powerful alternative to apologizing for America,"But when others make war on us, we will no longer be afraid to see what we see and respond accordingly."

2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"LEXINGTON, Va. — Mitt Romney vowed Monday to “recommit” the United States to a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, to put “clear conditions” on U.S. assistance to Egypt and to ensure Syrian opponents get access to needed weapons as he sought to define key foreign policy differences with President Obama."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"While putting some meat on the foreign policy bones his advisers have been outlining for months, the Republican presidential nominee also accused Mr. Obama of “passivity” on the international stage, which he said is damaging the interests of the U.S. and its allies."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“Hope is not a strategy,” Mr. Romney said at the Virginia Military Institute, asserting that the Obama administration has left people around the world wondering, “Where does America stand?” Mr. Romney said that if he is elected, the world will see clear and predictable behavior from the White House."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,But critics from the Obama camp and beyond said the address served only to bolster perceptions that the former Massachusetts governor is long on platitudes but short on substance when it comes to clear differences with the president on foreign policy.
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,“I would like to ask Gov.
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"Romney or his advisers exactly what he would do differently and how he would operate and how he truly understands what is going on in the Arab world and how deal with it,” former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said Monday in a conference call arranged by the Obama campaign."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"Mr. Romney laid out differences in what he called “bedrock principles” toward the Middle East, and said the U.S. must adhere to them in order to give American allies the certainty a stable world needs."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“No friend of America will question our commitment to support them, no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them, and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America’s capability to back up our words,” Mr. Romney said."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world,” he said."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,“The president has not signed one new free-trade agreement in the past four years.
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"I will reverse that failure.” On Iran, which is widely thought to be trying to acquire nuclear weapons, Mr. Romney remained vague on whether he would support a pre-emptive military strike, saying instead that “we must make clear to Iran through actions — not just words — that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.” He said U.S. aid to Egypt must come with new conditions that would push the new regime there to respect democracy and to live up to its peace treaty commitments with Israel."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"Just weeks after a video surfaced showing him sharing his doubts with donors about the viability of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, Mr. Romney punctuated Monday’s speech with a pledge to “recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.” “On this vital issue, the president has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new president will bring the chance to begin anew,” he said."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"When it comes to Syria, where opposition forces are in a bloody stalemate with the regime of Bashar Assad, Mr. Romney said the U.S. must do more to get arms into the hands of the rebels — at least those whom the U.S. trusts."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad’s tanks, helicopters and fighter jets,” Mr. Romney said."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,“Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them.
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran — rather than sitting on the sidelines.” Critics said Mr. Romney tried to carve out differences but didn’t articulate a dramatically different vision from the president’s.
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“When push comes to shove, it seems to me in this speech that Romney’s a realist and so is Obama,” said Gordon Adams, an international relations professor at American University who served on President Clinton’s national security staff during the mid-1990s."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“When it comes to defining exactly what Romney would do, whether it’s toward Iran or Egypt, or Libya or Syria or Israel, it’s pretty much the same thing when the rubber hits the road that Obama’s already doing,” Mr. Adams said."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“And where it’s not, it’s manifestly unrealistic.” He added that when it comes to overall U.S. foreign policy, “The elusiveness of strategy in the 21st century is intense, and it’s particularly intense in the region that Romney chose to focus on."
2641,1,Romney sees retreat in ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foreign policy,"“You need to be aware of the fact that not everybody looks to the United States to shape their course of events, and this is particularly true in the Mideast.” On the issue of standing up countering Iranian nuclear ambitions, Mrs. Albright said, “Short of immediate military action, [Mr. Romney] can’t specify what he’d do differently on Iran than the president.” U.S. assistance to Egypt, the former secretary of state added, is “already conditioned on many of the things that he listed, like Egypt meeting its obligations to its — the peace treaty with Israel and to proceed with its transition to democracy.”"

2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"WEYERS CAVE, Va. — The jobs picture improved in September, but Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said the fall in the nation’s jobless rate still is not enough to justify giving President Obama another term in office."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"“This is not what a real recovery looks like,” Mr. Romney said in a statement, pointing to what he said was a downward trend of job-creation."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"“We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we’ve lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since President Obama took office.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ key jobs survey said the economy added 114,000 new jobs in September, and BLS said the unemployment rate dipped to 7.8 percent — a drop of three-tenths of a percent."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"That means the rate is now back down to what it was in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office, inheriting a recession from President George W. Bush."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"BLS also revised July and August job numbers upward by a combined 86,000, suggesting a slightly better jobs picture over the summer than was reported at the time."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,The jobs news comes just two days after Mr. Romney seemed to be gaining momentum from a strong debate performance.
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"The Republican presidential nominee loses a major talking point from the campaign trail, where he regularly talked about the streak of consecutive months the unemployment rate had remained above 8 percent."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,Mr. Romney on Friday said the jobs picture is still bleak — particularly because of the millions who have dropped out of the market altogether.
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"“If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force, the real unemployment rate would be closer to 11 percent,” Mr. Romney said in his statement."
2645,1,Romney: Jobs growth not enough to re-elect Obama,"“The results of President Obama’s failed policies are staggering — 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty, and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families."

2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"11:56 a.m. | Updated After a lackluster debate, President Obama faced the prospect of a second piece of bad political news with Friday morning’s jobs report."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"Instead, Mr. Obama â and the economy â received some unexpected good news."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"Economists will spend the rest of the day parsing the numbers and arguing over exactly the best way to describe the report, but there is little question about its overall thrust: positive."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"An energized President Obama, appearing at a campaign rally outside Washington, seized on the news, saying “this country has come too far to turn back.â Speaking to about 1,900 supporters at George Mason University a few hours after the numbers were released, Mr. Obama said, âThis morning, we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"More Americans entered the work force; more people are getting jobs.â The rate dropped sharply, to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent, because the Labor Departmentâs survey of households showed a large gain in the number of employed people in September."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"The survey of businesses showed a smaller gain, but it also showed that hiring gains in July and August were larger than expected."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,Mr. Obama conceded that too many Americans were still out of work.
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"But he turned the good economic news into a rallying cry against his opponent, Mitt Romney, lashing him to the policies of the George W. Bush administration."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"âWeâve made too much progress to return to the policies that led to the crisis in the first place,â the president said to a chorus of cheers in an auditorium here."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"He added, âI wonât allow that to happen.â But Mitt Romney sought to deny Mr. Obama even the semblance of a victory lap, declaring, that âthis is not what a real recovery looks like."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and weâve lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since President Obama took office.â Campaigning in Abingdon, Va., Mr. Romney said the unemployment rate has declined because people have given up looking for work, and are no longer counted in the rate."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"“If you just give up and say, ‘Look I canât go back to work, Iâm just going to stay home,’ ” he said, “why youâre no longer part of the employment statistics."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"So it looks like unemployment is getting better, but the truth is, if the same share of people were participating in the workforce today as on the day the president got elected, our unemployment rate would be around 11 percent.” At this point in the presidential race, any single unemployment report is unlikely to have a major effect on the campaign."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"Friday’s report does not change the basic story line about the economy: it remains weak, and it continues to grow at a modest pace."

2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,Polls have consistently shown him with a small lead.
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,The worry among his campaign advisers is that Mr. Romneyâs strong performance in Wednesdayâs debate and Mr. Obamaâs weak one have the potential to be a watershed.
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"That concern no doubt remains, but it would have been all the stronger if the jobs report had been weaker."

2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"And a standard component of Mr. Romney’s case against Mr. Obama, on the campaign trail and in his advertising, is the fact that the unemployment rate had remained above 8 percent."

2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,That gain was the main reason for the sharp drop in the unemployment rate.
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"Of the gain, 582,000 of the jobs came among part-time workers who wanted to be working full time."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"The monthly survey of businesses showed a gain of only 114,000 jobs, which is in the broad range of the number needed merely to keep up with population growth."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"But each monthly jobs report also updates the numbers from the previous two months, as the Labor Department economists receive more detailed information."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"This month, that information showed that the economy gained 86,000 more jobs in July and August than previously thought, ameliorating earlier worries about a slowdown in August hiring."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"Combining the revisions with the September numbers, the new jobs report effectively shows a gain of 200,000 jobs in the business survey."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"In both the household survey and business survey, that is, the overall gain in full-time jobs was stronger than expected."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"In the last 12 months, the economy has gained an average of 150,000 jobs a month."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"It gained an average of 85,000 in 2010, and in 2009, it lost an average of 422,000."

2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"Mr. Obama has emphasized that the economy is moving in the right direction after a severe financial crisis, while Mr. Romney has emphasized that it has improved more slowly than many voters hoped or than Mr. Obama predicted."
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,The surprisingly strong report led to suggestions from some Republicans on Friday morning that Labor Department economists were manipulating the numbers for Mr. Obamaâs benefit.
2645,0,Jobs Report Brings Unexpected Good News for Obama,"On Twitter, Jack Welch, a Romney supporter and the former chief executive of General Electric, wrote: âUnbelievable jobs numbers … these Chicago guys will do anything … can’t debate so change numbers.â Many economists of both parties believe such accusations are false."

2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,(EDITOR’S NOTE — An occasional look at political claims that take shortcuts with the facts or don’t tell the full story.)
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney spun one-sided stories in their first presidential debate, not necessarily bogus, but not the whole truth."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"They made some flat-out flubs, too."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The rise in health insurance premiums has not been the slowest in 50 years, as Obama stated."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Far from it.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"And there are not 23 million unemployed, as Romney asserted."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Here’s a look at some of their claims and how they stack up with the facts: OBAMA: “I’ve proposed a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"… The way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 in additional revenue.” THE FACTS: In promising $4 trillion, Obama is already banking more than $2 trillion from legislation enacted along with Republicans last year that cut agency operating budgets and capped them for 10 years."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,He also claims more than $800 billion in war savings that would occur anyway.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,And he uses creative bookkeeping to hide spending on Medicare reimbursements to doctors.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Take those “cuts” away and Obama’s $2.50/$1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases shifts significantly more in the direction of tax increases.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Obama’s February budget offered proposals that would cut deficits over the coming decade by $2 trillion instead of $4 trillion.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Of that deficit reduction, tax increases accounted for $1.6 trillion."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,He promises relatively small spending cuts of $597 billion from big federal benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,He also proposed higher spending on infrastructure projects.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ ROMNEY:Obama’s health care plan “puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"I don’t like that idea.” THE FACTS:Romney is referring to the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel of experts that would have the power to force Medicare cuts if costs rise beyond certain levels and Congress fails to act."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"But Obama’s health care law explicitly prohibits the board from rationing care, shifting costs to retirees, restricting benefits or raising the Medicare eligibility age."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,So the board doesn’t have the power to dictate to doctors what treatments they can prescribe.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Romney seems to be resurrecting the assertion that Obama’s law would lead to rationing, made famous by former Alaska Gov."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Sarah Palin’s widely debunked allegation that it would create “death panels.” The board has yet to be named, and its members would ultimately have to be confirmed by the Senate."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Health care inflation has been modest in the last few years, so cuts would be unlikely for most of the rest of this decade."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"___ OBAMA: “Over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up — it’s true — but they’ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,So we’re already beginning to see progress.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you’re already getting a rebate.” THE FACTS: Not so, concerning premiums."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Obama is mixing overall health care spending, which has been growing at historically low levels, and health insurance premiums, which have continued to rise faster than wages and overall economic growth."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Premiums for job-based family coverage have risen by nearly $2,400 since 2009 when Obama took office, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"In 2011, premiums jumped by 9 percent."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"This year’s 4 percent increase was more manageable, but the price tag for family coverage stands at $15,745, with employees paying more than $4,300 of that."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"When it comes to insurance rebates under Obama’s health care law, less than 10 percent of people with private health insurance are benefiting."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,More than 160 million Americans under 65 have private insurance through their jobs and by buying their own policies.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"According to the administration, about 13 million people will benefit from rebates."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"And nearly two-thirds of that number will only be entitled to a share of it, since they are covered under job-based plans where their employer pays most of the premium and will get most of the rebate."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ ROMNEY on the failure of Obama’s economic policy: “And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,The proof of that is we’ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can’t find work.” THE FACTS: The number of unemployed is 12.5 million, not 23 million."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Romney was also counting 8 million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job and 2.6 million who have stopped looking for work, either because they are discouraged or because they are going back to school or for other reasons."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"He got the figure closer to right earlier in the debate, leaving out only the part-timers when he said the U.S. has “23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work.” But he was wrong in asserting that Obama came into office “facing 23 million people out of work.” At the start of Obama’s presidency, 12 million were out of work."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,His claim that half of college graduates can’t find work now also was problematic.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"A Northeastern University analysis for The Associated Press found that a quarter of graduates were probably unemployed and another quarter were underemployed, which means working in jobs that didn’t make full use of their skills or experience."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ OBAMA: It’s important “that we take some of the money that we’re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America.” THE FACTS: This oft-repeated claim is based on a fiscal fiction.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were paid for mostly with borrowed money, so stopping them doesn’t create a new pool of available cash that can be used for something else, like rebuilding America."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,It just slows down the government’s borrowing.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"___ ROMNEY: “At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Electric rates are up.” THE FACTS: He’s right that the average price has doubled, and a little more, since Obama was sworn in."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"But presidents have almost no influence on gasoline prices, and certainly not in the near term."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Gasoline prices are set on financial exchanges around the world and are based on a host of factors, most importantly the price of crude oil used to make gasoline, the amount of finished gasoline ready to be shipped and the capacity of refiners to make enough to meet market demand."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Retail electricity prices have risen since Obama took office — barely.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"They’ve grown by an average of less than 1 percent per year, less than the rate of inflation and slower than the historical growth in electricity prices."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The unexpectedly modest rise in electricity prices is because of the plummeting cost of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ OBAMA: “Gov.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Romney’s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut — on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts, that’s another trillion dollars — and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn’t asked for."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,That’s $8 trillion.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.” THE FACTS:Obama’s claim that Romney wants to cut taxes by $5 trillion doesn’t add up."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Presumably, Obama was talking about the effect of Romney’s tax plan over 10 years, which is common in Washington."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,But Obama’s math doesn’t take into account Romney’s entire plan.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Romney proposes to reduce income tax rates by 20 percent and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group, says that would reduce federal tax revenues by $465 billion in 2015, which would add up to about $5 trillion over 10 years."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"However, Romney says he wants to pay for the tax cuts by reducing or eliminating tax credits, deductions and exemptions."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,The goal is a simpler tax code that raises the same amount of money as the current system but does it in a more efficient manner.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The knock on Romney’s plan, which Obama accurately cited, is that Romney has refused to say which tax breaks he would eliminate to pay for the lower rates."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ ROMNEY: “What would I cut from spending?
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they pass it: Is the program so critical it’s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?” THE FACTS: China continues to be portrayed by Romney and many other Republicans as the poster child for runaway federal deficits."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"It’s true that China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, but it only represents about an 8 percent stake."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"And China has recently been decreasing its holdings, according to the Treasury Department."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Some two-thirds of the $16 trillion national debt is owed to the federal government, with the largest single stake the Federal Reserve, as well as American investors and the Social Security Trust Fund."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ OBAMA: “Independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Gov.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Romney’s pledge of not … adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.” THE FACTS: That’s just one scenario."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Obama’s claim relies on a study by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The study, however, is more nuanced than Obama indicated."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"The study concludes it would be impossible for Romney to meet all of his stated goals without shifting some of the tax burden from people who make more than $200,000 to people who make less."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"In one scenario, the study says, Romney’s proposal could result in a $2,000 tax increase for families who make less than $200,000 and have children."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Romney says his plan wouldn’t raise taxes on anyone, and his campaign points to several studies by conservative think tanks that dispute the Tax Policy Center’s findings."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Most of the conservative studies argue that Romney’s tax plan would stimulate economic growth, generating additional tax revenue without shifting any of the tax burden to the middle class."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Congress, however, doesn’t use those kinds of projections when it estimates the effect of tax legislation."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,___ ROMNEY on cutting the deficit: “Obamacare’s on my list.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,… I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"… I’ll make government more efficient.” THE FACTS:Romney has promised to balance the budget in eight years to 10 years, but he hasn’t offered a complete plan."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"Instead, he’s promised a set of principles, some of which — like increasing Pentagon spending and restoring more than $700 billion in cuts that Democrats made in Medicare over the coming decade — work against his goal."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,He also has said he will not consider tax increases.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"He pledges to shrink the government to 20 percent of the size of the economy, as opposed to more than 23 percent of gross domestic product now, by the end of his first term."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,The Romney campaign estimates that would require cuts of $500 billion from the 2016 budget alone.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"He also has pledged to cut tax rates by 20 percent, paying for them by eliminating tax breaks for the wealthiest and through economic growth."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"To fulfill his promise, then, Romney would require cuts to other programs so deep — under one calculation requiring cutting many areas of the domestic budget by one-third within four years — that they could never get through Congress."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,Cuts to domestic agencies would have to be particularly deep.
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"But he’s offered only a few modest examples of government programs he’d be willing to squeeze, like subsidies to PBS and Amtrak."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"He does want to repeal Obama’s big health care law, but that law is actually forecast to reduce the deficit."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"___ ROMNEY: “Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.” OBAMA: “That’s what we’ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we’re putting it before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan.” THE FACTS: At first, the president did largely ignore the recommendations made by his deficit commission headed by Democrat Erskine Bowles and Republican Alan Simpson."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"He later incorporated some of the proposals, largely the less controversial ones."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"He did not endorse some of the politically troublesome recommendations, such as trimming popular tax deductions like the one for home mortgage interest."
2648,1,FACT CHECK: Presidential debate missteps,"___ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Stephen Ohlemacher, Jonathan Fahey, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Tom Raum and Christopher S. Rugaber contributed to this report."

2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,Jeremiah Wright is a source of worry for a campaign that’s already on a knife’s edge over Wednesday night’s high-stakes debate in Denver and thinning leads in national polls.
2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,Obama’s aides and top Democratic officials projected an air of nonchalance and nothing-to-see-here Tuesday night as Fox News and Tucker Carlson’s Daily Caller promoted the 2007 speech at Hampton University as a racial rant with the capacity to change the game.
2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,But the reelection campaign is concerned especially by the possibility of re-litigating Wright’s role in Obama’s life — a storyline long seen in Obamaland as among the most damaging to the president.
2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,Story Continued Below ( Also on POLITICO: Media gives little play to Obama 2007 tape) That’s made even stronger by the new focus on the tape coming at a key moment in the run-up to the debate — timing that could become a distraction for the campaign as the president prepares to take the stage.
2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,The larger threat posed by the video isn’t its content — many of the statements Obama makes have been made by the president or other Democrats — but its capacity to stop the campaign’s accelerating momentum.
2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,Taken in combination with several other pre-debate problems for Obama — from tightening polls in Florida and Wisconsin and Vice President Joe Biden’s declaration Tuesday that the middle class has been “buried” over the last four years — the tape could be part of a movement that might make the race not the blowout many pundits have been predicting.
2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,"( Also on POLITICO: Obama's 2007 speech: How they covered it) Robert Gibbs, the former White House press secretary, called the video a “distraction,” but added on CBS’s “This Morning,” “If Republicans want to defend the Bush administration’s response to Katrina, I’m sure the president would give them his time during the debate to do that.” And sources inside the campaign tell POLITICO that they believe Carlson — and the Drudge Report — risked a backlash by emphasizing Obama’s use of church-pulpit African-American cadence."

2650,0,Video potential worry for Obama campaign,And unlike after the last Drudge video leak – a 1998 clip of Obama saying he is for the redistribution of wealth that Drudge unearthed in September – Romney didn’t himself appear on Fox News to talk about the video.

2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"There are 36 days left until Election Day, and that means that every day matters."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,But the next five days matter more than most when it comes to the race's final outcome.
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,Here's why: There are two seminal events in the campaign this week -- the first presidential debate on Wednesday night and the release of the September jobs report on Friday morning.
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"Yes, we know -- and have written about -- the fact that the general election debates in a presidential race may be less than meets the eye."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"And, yes, we know that the economy may well be a settled issue for most voters already -- a phenomenon expertly documented by BuzzFeed's Ben Smith and Zeke Miller."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"But the simple fact is that, for the 6 to 8 percent of the electorate who remains genuinely undecided (sidebar: Who are these people?!"
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"), the next five days could set a narrative that will push them to a choice sometime between now and Nov. 6."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,Let's run through three possible scenarios for how the week could play out -- and what it might mean for the race.
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"Scenario #1: Solid Romney debate, bad (under 80,000 jobs created) jobs report Romney has beaten the campaign collapse story back over the last few days as poll numbers in places like Iowa suggest what most smart political types knew all along: the country is too divided for Obama to run away with the election."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"If Romney looks up to the job Wednesday night and then the jobs report produces less-than-expected in terms of job creation, by this time next week the ""Romney momentum"" storyline will be in full swing."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"Scenario #2: Obama unscathed in debate, good (150,000 jobs created) jobs report The last three weeks or so have been the best of Obama's presidential campaign to date (nice timing if you are a Democrat)."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"If Obama is seen to have survived Wednesday's debate without taking any direct hits from Romney AND the jobs report produces some good-ish news, it would affirm the idea that the incumbent's case for a second term is growing stronger as the election approaches."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"Remember that much of the progress Obama has made nationally and in swing states in recent weeks is due to a renewed optimism about the economy and the direction of the country; if Obama has a strong jobs report to point to for the final month of the campaign, it will only make that argument more powerful to undecided voters."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"Scenario #3: Debate draw, mediocre (100,000 jobs created) jobs report Combine a debate that decides nothing with a jobs report that tells us nothing (really) about the direction of the economy, and this week will amount to a push -- setting the stage for the second and third debates later this month to potentially make more of a difference."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"One thought on a mediocre jobs report: The growing optimism we mentioned above doesn't seem to be based on any particular economic indicator, since all of the indicators seem to be pointing in different directions."
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,That suggests that no new news is good news for Obama on the economic front.
2651,0,Welcome to the most important week of the campaign,"If the jobs report produces headlines that point to a lack of clarity in the jobs picture, that sort of status quo-ness could well allow the incumbent to keep the perception of momentum -- or at least lurching progress -- he has been able to build over the past few weeks."

2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,Let's start with this simple political fact: There was NEVER going to be a good time for Mitt Romney to release his tax returns.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"As we have noted before, Romney's financial life as a very wealthy person is significantly more exotic than the average person he needs to vote for him; that he made almost $14 million in 2011 (and $21 million in 2010) without drawing any salary is all the confirmation you need of that fact."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"So, as soon as the Romney team made the strategic decision during the Republican primary process to hold the line on releasing no more than two past years of returns prior to the general election, they knew this day would come -- a day when Democrats would get a chance to sift through a window into his full financial portfolio for evidence that the caricature they have painted of him (rich, entitled businessman) was right."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,All the Romney campaign could control was when that day came.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,They chose today.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,But why?
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"Ask the campaign and, even when offered anonymity to speak candidly, top aides to Romney insist the returns were finished and signed by Romney yesterday and filed today, making today the obvious day to release them."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"Of course, if you believe the calculation of when to drop the 2011 returns -- as well as a summary of the past 20 years of tax rates the Romneys paid -- was entirely without political motive then we have a bridge to sell you."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,There's a number of reasons for why Romney chose today to swallow this uncomfortable political pill -- some logistical but mostly strategic.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"First, the logistical."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"Romney had said previously he would release his 2011 return before the Oct. 15 deadline and before the first general election presidential debate, which is set for Oct. 3."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,This release meets both of those criteria.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"Now, for the strategic."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,1\.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"It's Friday: The phrase ""Friday news dump"" has not become common parlance in Washington political news circles by accident."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"The reality of human nature -- and, yes, we are including reporters in that ""human"" category -- is that our attention span starts to wane as the weekend approaches."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"The story will get less attention late today than it would have on, say, a Tuesday morning."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,Fact.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,2\.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"It's already been a bad week: Romney's ""47 percent"" secret video comments ensured that the Republican presidential nominee had already lost this week on the big political scoreboard."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"(Heck, Romney had already won the Fix's ""Worst Week in Washington"" before the news of the tax return release broke this afternoon.)"
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,Political strategy 101 dictates that the best time to dump other bad new — at least in terms of political impact — is when things already are going badly so that it all gets wrapped into a single big story and you can then move on.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,Will Romney's tax returns be talked about on the Sunday chat show circuit?
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,Absolutely.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,But is that any worse from a political perspective than those same Sunday shows being dominated by chatter about why Romney hasn't run a better campaign?
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,Bad is bad.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,There are few gradations politically between bad and really bad.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,3\.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"The first debate is 12 days away: If Romney had waited to release his 2011 returns until, say, next Friday the first debate would be just 5 days away -- ensuring that there would be some (extended) discussion of them in it."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,And that's not what Romney wants.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"By releasing them today, it allows almost two weeks to pass before the debate, an amount of time that lets the GOP nominee dismiss the story as ""old news"" if and when Obama or one of the debate moderators brings it up."
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,The best case scenario for Romney on his tax returns (and his wealth more broadly) is that it takes up a single news cycle as people process the data in it and then move on.
2668,0,Why Mitt Romney released his 2011 tax returns today,"By dropping the 2011 return on a Friday afternoon, the Romney team is hoping that by Monday morning the political world has had its fill of the story and is back to talking about the economy and President Obama's handling of it."

2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,WASHINGTON (AP) — Now it’s Mitt Romney who wants to be the candidate of change.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Romney seized on President Barack Obama’s comment that “you can’t change Washington from the inside.” Grasping for a way to right his campaign and appeal to independents, the Republican nominee said he has what it takes to end the nasty partisanship in the nation’s capital."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"“I can change Washington,” Romney said Thursday."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,“I will change Washington.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,We’ll get the job done from the inside.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Republicans and Democrats will come together.” Romney was expected to press the issue again Friday during a campaign rally in Nevada, a state hard hit by the nation’s housing and unemployment woes."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Obama, traveling Friday to Virginia and addressing an AARP convention by satellite, planned to keep hammering Romney for comments he made in a private fundraiser about 47 percent of the country believing they are victims and entitled to a government handouts."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Obama, who ran for president in 2008 on a pledge to fix Washington’s combative tone, said in an interview that he had come to the conclusion “you can’t change Washington from the inside."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"You can only change it from the outside.” Adding that he wanted people to speak out on issues, he went on to say: “So something that I’d really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the American people so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move some of these issues forward.” After Romney focused on the “can’t change Washington from the inside” segment of Obama’s remarks, the president’s campaign countered quickly by noting that Romney said exactly that in 2007, when he was running for the 2008 Republican nomination: “I don’t think you change Washington from the inside."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"I think you change it from the outside.” Obama adviser David Axelrod defended the president’s comments on NBC’s “Today.” ”He said in order to move Washington and to move the Congress, you have to enlist the American people,” Axelrod said."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"“That was the lesson he learned from the standoff on the debt ceiling last summer, and he’s been making that point consistently,” Axelrod said."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,“The fact that Gov.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Romney picked up on it and attacked him on it is just one more example of how he’s just cascading from one gratuitous attack to another, instead of talking about solutions to the problems we face.” Obama’s campaign also released a web video Friday morning targeting older voters, many of whom would fall into the group of Americans Romney referenced when he said that nearly half of Americans don’t pay income tax but get benefits."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,Senior citizens receiving Medicare make up about 15 percent of those getting federal benefits; about 22 percent of those not paying income tax are seniors who get tax breaks that offset their income.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"The Obama video features voters commenting on Romney’s assertions, including one man who says “It offends me.” Polling shows Obama with a slight lead nationally, as well as in many of the eight or so battleground states that will decide the election."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"That includes Virginia, where Democrats with access to internal polling say Obama is up 3 or 4 percentage points over Romney in Virginia, a slimmer margin than in some recent public polling."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Obama has also pulled ahead of Romney in cash on hand, a key measure of a campaign’s financial strength."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"The Democrat has more than $88 million to spend in the campaign’s final weeks, while Romney has just over $50 million at his disposal."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,Romney’s campaign is seeking to regroup after a rough stretch that included the emergence of a video in which he tells wealthy donors at a private fundraiser that 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax and that they believe they are victims and entitled to an array of federal benefits.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,Obama has cast those remarks as a sign that Romney is out of touch with most Americans.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"“When you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven’t gotten around a lot,” Obama said Thursday during a forum on Univision, the Spanish-language TV network."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,Romney is also facing criticism from some in his own party that he’s spending too much time raising money and not enough time talking to voters in the eight or so battleground states that will decide the election.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"In response, his campaign added a Sunday rally in Colorado to his schedule and announced a three-day Ohio bus tour that kicks off Monday."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"At the same time, his wife, Ann, said GOP critics should lay off."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,“Stop it.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,This is hard.
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,You want to try it?
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"Get in the ring,” she said Thursday evening in an interview with Radio Iowa."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"“This is hard, and you know, it’s an important thing that we’re doing right now, and it’s an important election,” she said."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,"“And it is time for all Americans to realize how significant this election is and how lucky we are to have someone with Mitt’s qualifications and experience and know-how to be able to have the opportunity to run this country.” The president will campaign this weekend in Wisconsin, a state Romney is trying to put in play."
2669,1,Romney tries to seize mantle of change,Republicans are hoping the addition of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan to the GOP ticket will help them claim victory there — or at least force Obama to spend time and money to hold the state.

2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,The investigation came to light after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased as a part of Fast and Furious were found at the scene of the killing nearly two years ago of a U.S. Border Patrol agent.
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,The report recommended that 14 department employees be reviewed for possible sanctions or other disciplinary actions.
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"The report also says Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler, Mr. Holder’s chief of staff, received a briefing about Fast and Furious in March 2010, but that the briefing “failed to alert Mr. Grindler to problems in the investigation.” The report says Mr. Grindler learned three days after the Dec. 14, 2010, death of Border Patrol Agent Brian A.

2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"It said he should have “informed the attorney general as well as made an appropriate inquiry of ATF or the U.S. attorney’s office about the connection.” Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, who reviewed Fast and Furious wiretap applications, resigned Wednesday in the wake of the report, which says he should have asked more questions about Fast and Furious, given his knowledge of a similar 2006 program known as Operation Wide Receiver."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"Former Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson, named in the report as failing to maintain “appropriate oversight” of Fast and Furious, announced his retirement Wednesday, effective immediately."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"Seriously flawed According to the report, both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver were “seriously flawed and supervised irresponsibly” by ATF’s Phoenix field division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona, “most significantly in their failure to adequately consider the risk to the public safety in the United States and Mexico.” It said both investigations sought to identify the higher reaches of firearms-trafficking networks by deferring any overt law enforcement action against the individual straw buyers — such as making arrests or seizing firearms — even when there was sufficient evidence to do so."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"“The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations,” the report says."

2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,Holder’s response Mr. Holder said Wednesday the report’s key conclusions are “consistent” with what he and other Justice Department officials have said for many months: The inappropriate strategy and tactics employed were field-driven and date back to 2006; the leadership of the department did not know about or authorize the use of the flawed strategy and tactics; and the department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it.

2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"The report identifies persons ranging from field agents and prosecutors in Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., to senior ATF officials in Washington who “bore a share of responsibility” for ATF’s failures in both Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver to interdict firearms illegally bound for Mexico, and for pursuing “this risky strategy without adequately taking into account the significant danger to public safety that it created.” “We operated with complete and total independence in our search for the truth, and the decision about what to cover in this report and the conclusions we reached were made solely by me and my office,” Mr. Horowitz said."

2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"Lack of oversight According to the report, investigators found that no one responsible for the operations at either the ATF Phoenix field division or the U.S. attorney’s office raised serious questions or concerns about the government not taking earlier measures to disrupt a trafficking operation that continued to purchase firearms with impunity for many months."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,The report says that failure reflected a “significant lack of oversight and urgency” by both ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office and a “disregard by both” for the safety of persons in the United States and Mexico.
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"According to the report, Mr. Holder was notified immediately of Terry’s death but was not told about the connection between firearms found at the scene and Fast and Furious."

Grassley about the very same issue in late January 2011."

2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"It says they failed to exercise “appropriate oversight of the investigation, and to some extent were themselves receiving incorrect or incomplete information from their subordinates.” Mr. Holder said officials within ATF and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona identified in the report as having been responsible for designing, implementing or supervising Fast and Furious have been “referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions.” He declined to elaborate."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"Political reaction split Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the report “debunks many of the extreme allegations made by Republicans,” instead confirming conclusions reached in a minority report issued nearly a year ago that said neither Mr. Holder nor senior Justice Department officials authorized or approved of gun-walking in Fast and Furious, that gun-walking started under the President Bush’s administration in 2006, and that ATF agents in Phoenix and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona shared responsibility for “misguided operations spanning five years.” Mr. Grassley said the report confirmed that Fast and Furious was the “height of irresponsibility on the part of a number of people from the ATF Phoenix field office all the way up to the Justice Department headquarters.” He said he was “glad” Mr. Horowitz was joining with him and Mr. Issa in urging the Justice Department to unseal Fast and Furious wiretap applications “so the American people can read them and make up their own minds.” ATF shut down Fast and Furious after two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles purchased by straw buyers from a gun shop in Glendale, Ariz., were found near Terry’s body."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"The agent had been killed during a shootout with Mexican drug smugglers just north of the U.S.-Mexico border, south of Tucson."
2671,1,Management failures cited in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFast and FuriousÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ report,"The killing led to public testimony by ATF agents opposed to the operation, who said more than 2,000 weapons had been walked to drug smugglers in Mexico, about 1,400 of which are still unaccounted for."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Attorney General Eric Holder is ""spiking the football"" with the release of the DOJ Inspector General report about Operation Fast and Furious."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"The report essentially lets Holder off the hook while blaming everyone else, including his second hand man Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, for the failed and lethal operation."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"From the IG report: Attorney General Holder told the OIG that he did not hear of Operation Fast and Furious until late January or early February 2011, and was not aware of concerns with the tactics in the investigation until February."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"He said that he visited Sen. Grassley in the Senator’s office on January 31, 2011, and Sen. Grassley handed him two letters that referenced Project Gunrunner."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,Holder told us that he became familiar with the phrase “Fast and Furious” after visiting with Sen. Grassley.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,We found no evidence that Department or ATF staff informed Holder about Operation Fast and Furious prior to 2011.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Melson stated that he did not inform Holder about the investigation, and Burke said he did not recall doing so.231    Melson also stated that the Department was not involved in formulating any of the tactical decisions in the investigation."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,Holder said that Melson did not identify to him any problems about Operation Fast and Furious in 2009 and 2010.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,Our investigation did not identify evidence that contradicted Holder’s statements to us regarding his knowledge of Operation Fast and Furious and the use of “gun walking” tactics in that investigation.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"As we describe below, we identified information regarding Operation Fast and Furious that reached the Office of the Attorney General in 2010 but not Attorney General Holder himself."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"However, we found no evidence that this information included the inappropriate tactics at issue in Operation Fast and Furious."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,But what about the memos addressed directly to Holder about Fast and Furious?
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,The IG report says they never reached his desk.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"We found that the Offices of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General received 11 weekly reports in 2010 from ATF, DOJ’s Criminal Division, and the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) that referred to Operation Fast and Furious by name."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"For example, six of seven NDIC reports included among several other entries a summary of the support that NDIC had provided Operation Fast and Furious."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"The summary, which was identical in six of the reports except for certain dates, stated that Celis-Acosta and the straw purchasers in Operation Fast and Furious were responsible for trafficking 1,500 firearms to Mexican drug cartels.232    Attorney General Holder told the OIG that he did not believe that he reviewed these reports at the time that his office received them and that his staff did not bring them to his attention."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,Former Acting Deputy Attorney General Grindler stated that he had no recollection of having reviewed any weekly report concerning Operation Fast and Furious or of his staff highlighting such information for his review.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,We found no evidence that these weekly reports were forwarded to the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Holder put out a statement just moments ago, here it is in part."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"I have reviewed the Office of the Inspector General’s report on Operation Fast and Furious and the key conclusions are consistent with what I, and other Justice Department officials, have said for many months now: -The inappropriate strategy and tactics employed were field-driven and date back to 2006; -The leadership of the Department did not know about or authorize the use of the flawed strategy and tactics; and -The Department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"The last line is key, ""The Department’s leadership did not attempt to cover up information or mislead Congress about it."""
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Holder seems to have forgotten about the February 4, 2011 Fast and Furious letter edited multiple times by Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, signed by Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich, submitted to Congress and withdrawn nine months later due to being full of false and misleading information."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Holder also seems to have forgotten about the 74,000 Fast and Furious documents he has refused to hand over to Congressional investigators and his exective privilege bailout from President Obama back in June, further preventing Congress from obtaining more information."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"As a reminder, Holder changed his testimony about when he first found out about Fast and Furious, multiple times under oath."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,UPDATE: The IG report contradicts Holder's claims senior officials made no effort to mislead Congress.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"[B]y the date of its May 2 response letter, senior Department officials responsible for drafting the letter also knew or should have known that ATF had not made ‘every effort to interdict weapons purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico,’ either in Operation Fast and Furious or other firearms trafficking investigations, and that the Department's February 4 letter contained inaccuracies and could no longer be defended in its entirety …."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Given that senior Department officials' confidence in the accuracy of the February 4 letter was decreasing rather than increasing as their internal review progressed, the OIG found it troubling that the Department's subsequent May 2 letter to Sen. Grassley included a substantive statement - albeit a qualified one - regarding the Fast and Furious investigation that could have been read to reaffirm the prior questioned letter …."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Similarly, the report found that the Department should not have provided testimony on June 15 before the House Committee on Oversight and Governmental Reform in a manner that created ambiguity and uncertainty regarding whether the Department was still defending its February 4 and May 2 letters."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Holder is also moving quickly to ""hold people accountable"" for the operation."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"“Based upon the information in the OIG report and other related information, I am also announcing additional personnel changes today."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"“First, Kenneth Melson, the former Acting Director at ATF, has retired from the Department, effective immediately."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Ken has served the Department in several important roles for over thirty years, including as a United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and more recently as an advisor on forensic science issues."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,I want to thank him for his dedication and service to the Department over the last three decades.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"“Second, those individuals within ATF and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona, whom the OIG report found to have been responsible for designing, implementing or supervising Operation Fast and Furious have been referred to the appropriate entities for review and consideration of potential personnel actions."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Act, the Department is prohibited from revealing any additional information about these referrals at this time."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"“Finally, I have accepted the resignation of Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, a longtime career prosecutor who most recently served in the Criminal Division where he led our violent and organized crime, computer crimes and intellectual property enforcement efforts."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,Jason has dedicated much of his career to fighting violent crime and has led highly successful efforts around the country in this effort.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,The American people are safer because of his work.
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"His commitment to the Department has been unwavering, and I deeply appreciate his 15 years of distinguished service here at Main Justice as well as in Baltimore and New York."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Now that the DOJ investigation of the DOJ is complete, will Holder release the remaining 74,000 Fast and Furious documents to Congress?"
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"In the name of transparency, the answer should be yes."
2672,1,Eric Holder Does a Victory Dance Around Fast and Furious,"Parting thought: If Holder's hands really are clean in this, why is the executive privilege necessary?"

2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","Political pundits are comparing the leaked video of Mitt Romney at a fundraiser writing off the 47 percent of the electorate who don’t pay federal income taxes to the leaked 2008 fundraiser video of then-Sen. Barack Obama blaming his problems in the Pennsylvania Democratic Primary on bitter voters who “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them.” But while Obama was talking about something in contradiction to his campaign message – talking down the very voters he was trying to persuade to come to his side – Romney was actually on message, just in more blunt fashion than usual."
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","In his secretly recorded fundraiser comments, Obama was saying that he needed to convince the bitter clingers that he really was on their side and show them that he would increase taxes on what even back then he was calling the “1 percent” in order to provide them more generous benefits."
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",[pullquote] Obama’s message was that he could show blue-collar voters that he was on their side with his message about tax increases and make them overcome their own racist or xenophobic tendencies.

2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","While Obama was explaining his bid to woo voters opposed to him and favorable to Hillary Clinton in the primary and a Republican candidate in the general election, Romney was explaining why he was writing off a huge chunk of the electorate."
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","And while Democrats may disagree with Romney about what motivates those who are bound to choose Obama, no one can disagree that he’s pretty close to right about the number and the fact that they aren’t coming over to the red side this year."
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",The current of Romney’s campaign is an idea that has long animated the American right: the makers versus the takers.

2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","The more people who receive benefits from the government, the more people who will vote for increased government benefits."

2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","Government-worker unions provide the funds and organization to elect Democrats, who in turn expand the pay, benefits and privileges of government union members."

2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",Romney is trying to expand that argument beyond the government workers fight.
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","He is, in some moments at least, calling for a national referendum on the question of how much government we can afford, even if we like the benefits obtained from it."
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","In other moments, Romney seems to retreat into an argument basically about competency."

2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",Romney says he can manage better and should be given the big job on the grounds of competency alone.
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",But the video is evidence that there is an ideological current running through the former Massachusetts governors’ campaign – a current best exemplified in Romney’s decision to tap Paul Ryan as his running mate.
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",This idea about the dangers having too many citizens reliant on government outlays has animated Ryan’s entire career.
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach",Republicans like Ryan have long warned of a tipping-point moment in which Democrats will have included so many voters in federal benefits that there aren’t enough net contributors to vote in favor of reducing the size of government.
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","Romney and his campaign have seemed to back off that argument in their convention and subsequent campaigning, shifting back to the competency argument rather than the message that the country is heading off a cliff off government dependency that once breached, cannot be undone."
2674,1,"With Video Leak, Romney Goes Back to Bold Approach","It’s an approach that carries the risk of a big defeat, but it’s still a better one for Romney."

2676,0,Mitt Romney abruptly shifts strategy,"Stevens said the big, unifying question will be: “Can we do better on every front?” On Monday, Romney unveiled a new ad, “ The Romney Plan,” that punches back at Obama’s consistent emphasis on growing the economy for the middle class, and emphasizes what the Republican would do."

2676,0,Mitt Romney abruptly shifts strategy,"“I believe we can all agree that what we need are fair and enforceable immigration laws that will stem the flow of illegal immigration, while strengthening legal immigration.” Arguing that Romney is doing better than many pundits recognize, Stevens said the Middle East unrest and continuing economic unease will help the Republican regain momentum and quiet the concerns among GOP insiders."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"LOS ANGELES — Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will recalibrate his message over the final weeks of the race, his campaign said Monday, putting a “new emphasis” on the “specific aspects” of his policy prescriptions for strengthening the nation’s economy and foreign policy abroad."

2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"The first taste of the rebooted message came in the form of two new television advertisements and in an address Mr. Romney delivered to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce conference at a hotel conference center here, where he pledged to expand school choice for low-income children and special-needs students and to sign new trade agreements with Latin American countries."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"Ticking off his five-point plan “to help the middle-class,” Mr. Romney vowed to remove the barriers blocking the nation from tapping into its oil, coal and natural gas supplies, and become energy independent by 2020."

2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"Mr. Stevens, according to the report, has become a scapegoat for people upset over the way the GOP convention came off — particularly Mr. Romney’s failure to mention Afghanistan in his acceptance speech as well as the appearance of Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood, who took the focus off the Republican nominee with his empty-chair routine."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"“In a convention where Clint Eastwood’s debacle of a performance was the takeaway for most Americans, at least according to the polls, no one can say with a straight face that what happened down in Tampa was a successful convention,” said Jim Manley, a Democratic consultant."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"“The fact is, they were in a need of a boost coming out of the thing and they didn’t get it.” The latest Real Clear Politics average of national polls shows that 50 days out from Election Day, President Obama has a 3-point edge."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"Despite national unemployment still hovering at about 8 percent, the Democrat also is leading in key battleground states, including Ohio, Florida and Virginia — raising questions about whether the Romney camp needs to rejigger its approach."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"“Of course, time will only tell, but the Gillespie conference call likely indicates the biggest shift in campaign strategy for Team Romney since it selected Paul Ryan as Romney’s vice presidential running mate,” said Ford O’Connell, a GOP strategist."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"“Put another way, the Romney campaign knows it is losing and with 50 days to go, it knows it must change its strategy if they are going to win in November.” With that as a backdrop, Mr. Gillespie shrugged off the idea that the convention fell short of expectations, saying it allowed voters to get to know Mr. Romney the person, and now it is time for voters to get a better picture of policy."
2676,1,Romney plans new emphasis on economic details,"“This push reflects our view that after a successful convention, where people learned and voters learned a lot about Mitt Romney as a person, they are eager to hear more details about policies to turn our economy around and create 12 million new jobs in his first term,” Mr. Gillespie said."

2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"CHICAGO — As the president of the Chicago Teachers Union emerged from a meeting of her union delegates on Sunday night to announce that, no, school would not be starting up again and that, no, the delegates were not ready to sign off on what had seemed like a deal, Mayor Rahm Emanuel watched her on a television in City Hall."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"If the rest of the city was stunned to learn that the teachers’ strike was not over, Mr. Emanuel appeared disappointed but relatively calm, those with him said, having already gamed out just such a possibility with his aides."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"Not long after, he issued a statement that, in trademark tough-guy form, offered not even a passing whiff of conciliation: he accused the union of using children as pawns, and said he was going to court — an option he had checked on weeks ago, just in case, and one he carried out first thing Monday morning."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"While hundreds of thousands of Chicago children have begun a second week with no classes, Mr. Emanuel has placed himself firmly in the center of the standoff."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"He has been the loudest, pushiest voice for longer school days and tougher teacher evaluations, and he now finds himself as the target of fury in the picket lines around the city, where some teachers wear buttons showing a line drawn through Mr. Emanuel’s face and others carry signs that demand, “What’s Rahm With You?” The risks, politically, are enormous."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"Much depends on what happens Tuesday, when the union’s delegates meet to again consider a deal their negotiators, including Karen Lewis, the union president, reached with negotiators from the Chicago Public Schools."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"But few have as much stake in what comes next — a quick reopening of schools by Wednesday or a far longer, grimmer battle — as Mr. Emanuel."

2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,“And it’s the first issue where he’s really coming up on the wrong side of the polls.
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"He made this personal, and now it’s his.” As promised, Mr. Emanuel’s administration on Monday sought a preliminary injunction to end the strike, maintaining that state law “expressly prohibits” teachers from striking over noneconomic issues, including layoffs and teacher evaluations."
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,A judge was expected to hear the case on Wednesday morning if schools had not reopened.
2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"But to union leaders, the legal filing was only the latest example of Mr. Emanuel’s “bullying behavior,” said a union spokeswoman, Stephanie Gadlin, who described the injunction as a “vindictive act instigated by the mayor.” Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University, described Mr. Emanuel’s decision to take the matter to court now as “a declaration of war,” adding, “I don’t think the mayor understands that the goal of negotiating is to get an agreement, not to win.” If teachers continue the strike beyond Tuesday, they risk losing support from students’ families, many of whom expressed patience in the first week of the strike but were sounding increasingly exasperated heading into Week 2."

2677,0,Chicago Teachers Strike Enters Second Week,"Mr. Emanuel has his enthusiastic backers in his push for more days and hours in school and for teacher evaluations that consider student test scores, but unions beyond those that represent teachers are irked at Mr. Emanuel’s aggressive handling of the situation."

2689,0,Obama Convention Bounce Confirmed In Latest Tracking Polls,"The HuffPost Pollster chart, which is designed to smooth out day-to-day statistical noise, currently shows a slightly narrower lead for Obama than it did in August, owing to the greater influence of the daily tracking polls."

2697,1,Obama campaign: 'Tonight is not about magic',"President Obama planned to tell voters in his nomination speech Thursday night that he needs “more than a few years” to tackle the country’s challenges, claiming he’s still going through an inbox that had “built up over decades.” In prepared remarks released ahead of the president’s convention address, Obama says, as he has before, that this election is about “two fundamentally different visions for the future.” He describes his plan as a tougher one, but one that leads to better results."
2697,1,Obama campaign: 'Tonight is not about magic',“I won’t pretend the path I’m offering is quick or easy.

2697,1,Obama campaign: 'Tonight is not about magic',Our challenges can be met.
2697,1,Obama campaign: 'Tonight is not about magic',"The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place.” Earlier in the day, Obama campaign officials suggested the president’s critical address would drop some of the lofty rhetoric from 2008 and aim more to spell out a plan for the country."

2697,1,Obama campaign: 'Tonight is not about magic',"A bullet-point outline released by the campaign said the president is setting goals to “double exports by the end of 2014,” “cut net oil imports in half by 2020” and “reduce the deficit by more than $4 trillion over the next decade.” The speech excepts show Obama invoking President Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal."

2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Democrats rushed to clean up a party platform mess Wednesday and moved to officially re-nominate President Obama for a second term in office as his predecessor, former President Bill Clinton, said voters this year must choose between Republicans’ “winner-take-all” vision of success and his own party’s “shared prosperity.” Mr. Clinton, who left office amid budget surpluses and a roaring economy, delivered a point-by-point rebuttal to Republicans’ convention last week in Tampa, mixing deep policy talk with one-liners that had delegates here roaring with laughter."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Looking older but speaking with passion and the same thumb-gestures that made him ripe for caricature during his time in office, the former president harkened back to a Republican Party he said he used to be able to work with, but which he said has since become riven by a desire for conflict rather than cooperation."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Mr. Clinton also said it was impossible for any president in a single term to “repair all the damage” that Mr. Obama found when he took office, but said he’s laid the groundwork for a recovery."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,He said that’s what this year’s election comes down to.
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“The most important question is, what kind of country do you want to live in?” Mr. Clinton said."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“If you want a winner-take-all, you’re-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility — a we’re-all-in-this-together society — you should vote for Barack Obama.” Mr. Obama himself arrived in Charlotte Wednesday afternoon and prepared for his Thursday speech accepting his party’s nomination.
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"He had been slated to speak at Bank of America Stadium, in front of more than 65,000 cheering supporters, much as he did four years ago to a stadium audience in Denver."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,But his campaign on Wednesday canceled the stadium and said Thursday’s speeches will take place in the much smaller arena where the convention met on Tuesday and Wednesday.
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"The party blamed the chances of thunderstorms, and said it would hold a conference call with those who’d gotten tickets for the stadium but would now be shut out."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Republicans, though, said the president was afraid he wouldn’t be able to fill the stadium, which they said highlighted the gap in enthusiasm for Mr. Obama compared to 2008, when he filled the stadium in Denver."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Democrats also scrambled to recover after they adopted a platform earlier this week that excluded language declaring U.S. support for Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and dropped a mention of God that had been in previous platforms."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,On Wednesday they held a voice vote trying to add Jerusalem and God provisions back in — but had to hold the vote several times before the “Yes” votes clearly out-shouted the “No” votes.
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,The White House had pushed to add the language back in after platform became a distraction from their message.
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Democrats are desperate to frame this year’s election as a choice between candidates rather than a referendum on Mr. Obama’s stewardship of the economy, and have repeatedly turned to social issues to try to peel black, Hispanic and women voters away from the GOP."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"On Wednesday Sandra Fluke, the woman who Republicans denied a chance to testify to Congress on her support for Mr. Obama’s contraceptive policy, told the convention Mr. Romney “wont stand up to the slurs, or to any of the extreme, bigoted views in his own party.” But it was Mr. Clinton, the man who led Democrats back to the White House in the 1990s, who was left the task of explaining the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“He inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a more modern, more well-balances economy,” Mr. Clinton said in a speech that, in typical Clinton fashion, ran more than 20 minutes past his allotted time."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Mr. Clinton laid out math he said showed that over the last half-century, Democrats and Republicans have held the White House for about the same number of years, but Democrats lead in job-creation, 42 million to 24 million."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“It turns out that advancing economic opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and good economics,” he said, drawing repeated shouts of “We love you Bill!” from delegates."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Mr. Clinton also looked past Mr. Obama’s legislative agenda such as health care and the stimulus, which he passed almost exclusively on Democratic votes, and said the president is committed to cooperation."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"He pointed to Mr. Obama’s openness to working with former rivals, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“Heck, he even appointed Hillary,” Mr. Clinton said, pointing to his wife, who after losing to Mr. Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary accepted a role as his secretary of state."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Republicans said inviting Mr. Clinton to speak was a danger for Democrats, arguing he would hurt Mr. Obama by highlighting the differences between the two."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“My guess is, we’ll get a great rendition of how good things were in the 1990s but we’re not going to hear much about how things have been in the last four years,” Republican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan said as he campaigned in Iowa."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"For his part Mr. Romney, the GOP’s nominee, remained holed up in Vermont prepping for the series of October debates — the next major set pieces in the presidential campaign."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"He and Mr. Obama are running about even in national polls, though the president is ahead in polling in nearly every battleground state."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"At their convention, Democrats were poised to nominate Mr. Obama unanimously, but the platform flap underscored divisions within his party that have dampened the enthusiasm that powered him to victory in 2008."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,Even some top lawmakers are wary of appearing near him.
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"On Wednesday, Democrats highlighted their 12 female U.S. senators — but only nine of them showed."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"Among the three absent lawmakers was Sen. Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who is seeking re-election and is trying to distance herself from Mr. Obama after being a chief surrogate for him in 2008."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"In a campaign marked by decidedly personal barbs, Democrats lobbed some stiff attacks at Mr. Romney, including highlighting employees who were laid off after Bain Capital — Mr. Romney’s former company — took over their plant."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"“Mitt Romney once said, ‘I like being able to fire people.’ Well I can tell you from personal experience, he does,” said Randy Johnson, one of three workers who said Bain Capital cost him his job."
2698,1,Clinton returns to back Obama at DNC,"He and the other workers said they understand businesses failing, but said they faulted Mr. Romney for earning profits while shutting plants down."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Former President Bill Clinton and President Obama hugged onstage Wednesday night after Mr. Clinton delivered an impassioned plea on behalf of Mr. Obama’s re-election, the 42nd president nominating the 44th to a second term with a forceful and spirited argument that Democratic values would restore the promise of the middle class."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"The former president delivered a point-by-point rebuttal of the arguments made during the Republican National Convention last week, warning against Republicans taking back the White House and declaring, “We can’t let it happen.” He offered an equally detailed affirmative case for the re-election of Mr. Obama, saying there was no question the country was in a better position than it was four years ago."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"“We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickle down,” Mr. Clinton said, repeatedly bringing the crowd at the Democratic convention to its feet."

2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"The delegates at the Democratic convention conducted the ceremonial roll call vote after Mr. Clinton’s speech, with Ohio putting Mr. Obama over the top and formally elevating him as the party’s presidential nominee at 12:06 a.m."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"In a convention hall still buzzing from Mr. Clinton’s speech well after it ended, delegates said they believed the former president had managed to give the defense of Mr. Obama they had been waiting for."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"“Some people just have to have it spelled out for them,” said Linda Brooks, 64, of Hampton Roads, Va. “He speaks in plain words people can understand.” In the 45-minute speech, Mr. Clinton paid tribute to a spirit of bipartisan political cooperation that he lamented was now missing."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"He characterized Mr. Obama as a president who wanted to bring that spirit back, noting that the president appointed Republican cabinet secretaries and former political rivals like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Clinton’s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"The relationship they built, he said, sent a signal abroad."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"“Democracy does not have to be a blood sport,” Mr. Clinton said."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"“It can be an honorable enterprise.” The arrival here by Mr. Clinton had the feel of a valedictory, particularly as Mr. Obama arrived on stage at the end of the speech, while thousands of Democrats here thundered their approval."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"It was, perhaps, a capstone in the political career of Mr. Clinton, who was delivering his eighth speech to a Democratic National Convention."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"Mr. Clinton offered a comprehensive, even exhaustive, assessment of Mr. Obama’s first-term priorities, from the auto bailout to the health care law."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"Brandishing statistics with a familiar vigor, he laid out a case that each of Mr. Obama’s initiatives had met the Republican litmus test: leaving Americans better than four years ago."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,“Is the president satisfied?
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"Of course not, but are we better off than we were when he took office?” Mr. Clinton said, pausing as the crowd roared in approval."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"He added, “The answer is yes.” Mr. Clinton used the successful economic record of his presidency to offer an illustration of the magnitude of the problems Mr. Obama inherited when he took office in 2009."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"“President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did,” Mr. Clinton said."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"“No president, not me, not any of my predecessors, could have repaired all of the damage he found in just four years.” Following the speech by Michelle Obama on Tuesday night, the appearance of Mr. Clinton was the highlight of the convention’s second night and underscored the tight nature of the presidential race."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"He was invited by Mr. Obama himself, who asked him earlier this summer to become more involved in his re-election campaign."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"It was in many ways a poignant evening, in part because it marked the full reconciliation of the two most popular Democrats of the past 30 years, but also because Mr. Clinton has been increasingly talking about his own mortality."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"Mr. Clinton’s voice was hoarse, as it has often been through his career, but that seemed to do little though to tamp down his energy, enthusiasm or appeal to the crowd."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"Mr. Clinton’s presence here inspired gratitude among Mr. Obama’s aides and followers, particularly given the close nature of the presidential race, but it also stirred at least a degree of speculation about the future of one of America’s most prominent political families."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"For all of Mr. Clinton’s ebullient praise of Mr. Obama, he also was seen by some Democrats as setting the stage for his wife’s possible return to politics in 2016, a prospect yearned for by many of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"He made only a quick reference to his wife, drawing laughter from the crowd as he raised another attribute of Mr. Obama, declaring: “Heck, he even appointed Hillary!” For Mr. Clinton, the speech dramatized the evolution in his relationship with Mr. Obama, from bitter antagonism to cautious embrace and now a full-throated endorsement."
2698,0,Clinton Delivers Stirring Plea for Obama Second Term,"People who know both men do not play down the lingering tension between them, a legacy of the 2008 Democratic primary, when Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton in a fierce battle that seemed to leave Mr. Clinton more wounded than his wife."

2706,0,Sept. 1: RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Convention Bounce Appears Middling So Far,That survey showed him pulling into a 3-point lead against President Obama on Saturday.
2706,0,Sept. 1: RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Convention Bounce Appears Middling So Far,"All of the interviews in the Rasmussen poll were conducted after the convention began, although only about one-third were conducted after Mr. Romney’s acceptance speech on Thursday night."

2710,0,The race canard,Silly season is over.
2710,0,The race canard,Racist season is here.
2710,0,The race canard,Silly season is when nothing is going on in the presidential campaign and the debate focuses on trivialities.
2710,0,The race canard,Racist season is when the presidential campaign begins in earnest and President Barack Obama looks vulnerable.
2710,0,The race canard,"Then, liberal commentators pull out all the stops to deem practically any criticism of the president racist."
2710,0,The race canard,Story Continued Below Chris Matthews of MSNBC led the charge this week with an on-set rant against Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
2710,0,The race canard,"Matthews didn’t muster an argument so much as an accusation — a lot of them, actually."
2710,0,The race canard,Criticizing the gutting of welfare reform?
2710,0,The race canard,That’s racist.
2710,0,The race canard,GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s joke about no one ever asking for his birth certificate?
2710,0,The race canard,"Racist, too."
2710,0,The race canard,Saying the president is inspired by a European welfare-state model?
2710,0,The race canard,Obviously racist.
2710,0,The race canard,Priebus looked like he’d been button-holed by a persistent drunk at a bar and didn’t know how to get away.
2710,0,The race canard,"Thomas Edsall, the respected former Washington Post reporter now at the Columbia Journalism School, bested Matthews by declaring Romney’s ad against the Obama’s Medicare cuts racist."
2710,0,The race canard,Timothy Noah of The New Republic seconded Edsall’s insight.
2710,0,The race canard,The impressively single-named commentator Touré claimed that calling the Obama campaign “angry” is racist — a close cousin to the argument that calling him “arrogant” is racist.
2710,0,The race canard,It’s only late August and the campaign is tied.
2710,0,The race canard,Wait until October.
2710,0,The race canard,Particularly if it’s equally close or if Obama is trailing.
2710,0,The race canard,"In the imaginations of the president’s devotees, an America where he is behind by 2 or 3 points will be indistinguishable from an America where blacks are set on by dogs during Civil Rights marches."
2710,0,The race canard,"Technically, Touré didn’t find Romney guilty of racism, only “niggerification,” which must be one of the ugliest neologisms in the history of the language."
2710,0,The race canard,(He later apologized for using the term.)
2710,0,The race canard,"Allegedly, Romney was playing to negative racial stereotypes."
2710,0,The race canard,"But even if you accept Touré’s assumptions — which is not recommended — Romney called the president’s “campaign,” not the president, angry."
2710,0,The race canard,You can argue with the word choice.
2710,0,The race canard,“Conscienceless” or “reptilian” seem more apt to me — but “angry” is not racist.
2710,0,The race canard,As for that other adjectival offense against the president—calling him arrogant—it’s hard to remember a time when one party has criticized the leader of the other party for his modesty.
2710,0,The race canard,Republicans attacked President Bill Clinton for being arrogant.
2710,0,The race canard,Democrats attacked President George W. Bush for being arrogant.
2710,0,The race canard,"Now, it’s Obama’s turn."

2710,0,The race canard,"When Romney joked in Michigan that no one ever had to ask for his birth certificate, it was a banner day in the racist season."
2710,0,The race canard,"Michael Eric Dyson, who apparently earned an advanced degree in finding obscure ways to accuse people of bigotry, detected the tell-tale signs of “othering.” “Other” used to be a perfectly fine word, until it became a jargony verb fit for use only by people with regular MSNBC gigs — or endowed chairs in nonsense."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,You're already aware that MSNBC -- America's self-appointed racist dog whistle truth squad -- oddly chose not to air numerous speeches delivered by racial minorities at last night's Republican convention.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"They have a narrative to protect, and all that."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,But the Left-wing cable news channel isn't the only outlet following Chris Matthews down the path of unhinged and shameless race-baiting.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"The LA Times gets in on the act with an editorial cartoon and column accusing Republicans of using their convention to put a ""brown face"" on their racist, white party: Republicans are racist if they don't include people of color, but when they do include people of color, it merely highlights their broader racism."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,See how this works?
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"Meanwhile, other news outlets are content to simply invent instances of bigotry: [A]s a Puerto Rican party functionary—Zoraida Fonalledas, the chairwoman of the Committee on Permanent Organization—took her turn at the main-stage lectern."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"As she began speaking in her accented English, some in the crowd started shouting “U.S.A.!"
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,U.S.A.!” The chanting carried on for nearly a minute while most of the other delegates and the media stood by in stunned silence.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"The Puerto Rican correspondent turned to me and asked, “Is this happening?” Tim Carney explains what was actually going on (hint: a floor dispute with zero connection to race): Here’s what happened, Jack: RNC Chairman Reince Preibus had called for a voice vote to approve the Credential Committee’s report."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"Ron Paul delegates objected, because the committee had refused to seat half of the Paul delegates."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"When the voice vote came, the “Noes” clearly were louder than the “Ayes.” (Ron Paul backers are pretty good at shouting.)"
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"Preibus ruled that the Ayes had won, and then he ignored many yells of “Point of Order.” The Paulites began chanting “Point of Order,” trying to stop the proceedings so they could have a roll-call vote or even a debate."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"They also chanted “Seat Maine Now,” in this period."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,Some Romney backers from delegations near Maine responded – for better or worse – by chanting “U.S.A.!
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,U.S.A.!” over the Paulites’ chants.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"It's revealing that ""the media stood by in stunned silence,"" instantly and erroneously imputing racial nastiness to RNC delegates during this fracas."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,Their default assumption was that Republicans were maliciously drowning out an Hispanic woman.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"Why bother, you know, reporting on an occurrence when meme-fueling conjecture is so much easier?"
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"Unsurprisingly, some media outlets are wildly hyping an odious, isolated incident of genuine racism, for which an unidentified convention-goer was expelled last night."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"But I somehow I suspect you won't hear much about this story because, you see, deranged racist liberals don't count because...well, just because."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,Shut up.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,Thus the MSM race obsession rolls on.
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"I'll leave you with three items: (1) NBC News embedded several clips of ""notable speeches"" from last night on its website."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,What do almost all of these speakers have in common?
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"I guess the journalists of NBC believe John Boehner's unremarkable comments are more ""notable"" than anything Mia Love, Sher Valenzuela, Brian Sandoval or Artur Davis had to say."
2710,1,The MSM's Hyper-Racial RNC Coverage,"(2) ""Hot mic"" audio of ~~ABC News~~ Yahoo News employees laughing about Republican racism (vis-a-vis Isaac) when they thought no one was listening."

2711,0,Paul Ryan Address: Convention Speech Built On Demonstrably Misleading Assertions,"He also made a cornerstone of his argument the claim that Obama ""funneled"" $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare."

2711,0,Paul Ryan Address: Convention Speech Built On Demonstrably Misleading Assertions,Ryan also put responsibility for Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. government debt at Obama's doorstep.

2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,\-- Soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in an op-ed written for the Wall Street Journal.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,Try to figure how a poll which shows 57 percent of likely voters believe America is a civilization in decline and that has a huge plurality believing the country has changed for the worse in the past years still shows a dead-heat between an incumbent president and his Republican challenger.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,If you look at the latest FOX News poll just as it relates to President Obama it seems unimaginable that any incumbent in such a condition could win reelection.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"\-- Obama is upside down on his overall job approval and lags on his handling of the economy, the number one issue this year by 12 points."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"\-- By an almost 20-point margin, respondents said that they would rather the federal government leave them alone than lend them a hand."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"\-- When asked whether it was fair to say Obama wants to make Americans more dependent on the government, 53 percent said yes and only 44 percent said no."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"That is a dire slate for any incumbent Democrat, but particularly bad for one whose major liabilities relate to spending too much and intervening too much while failing to revive the consistently crummy economy."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"For all the talk about the Obama Democrats “defining” Republican Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, one thing is very clear: the president is very well defined after four years as a big-government liberal."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,That’s not a good brand in swing-state America.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,So how is the race still tied?
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,Because the effort to define Romney has been nearly as successful.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,The 10 percent of respondents who said they were undecided or rejected the major party choices reveal that the holdouts in the 2012 election find little to like in Romney.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,This group strongly disapproves of the president’s performance (to the tune of 55 percent) but doesn’t seem very pleased with the GOP nominee either.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"While Obama suffers a 12-point deficit on personal favorability among these voters, Romney’s rating stands at a whopper-jawed negative 28 points."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,Every re-election campaign is about the electorate answering two questions: Do we want to keep the guy we have and is the person running to replace him a plausible pick?
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"As we prepare for the two-week convention kick off for the fall campaign, it is clear that Obama has failed the first question."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,With 74 days until the election there isn’t a way for the president to turn public sentiment in favor of his administration.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"That’s probably been a lost cause since May, but now the window is firmly closed."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,That’s why Obama and his team have focused on personal attacks on Romney for nearly five months.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"As Vice President Joe Biden so often says, “Don’t compare us to the almighty, compare us to the alternative.” The central emphasis of the Obama campaign has been to make Romney an unacceptable alternative."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"But given all of the slashing and bashing so far, Romney is still hanging on."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,Respondents in the poll were 6 points less inclined to believe Romney wanted to make the rich richer but neglect everyone else – a charge that is the ethos of the Obama campaign – than they were the Republican charge that Obama is seeking greater government dependency.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,The other big knock on Romney is that he is more interested in political expedience than principle.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"While nearly 60 percent said Romney would “say and do just about anything to get elected,” Obama scored just as poorly."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,And therein is revealed the danger for the president.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"He has succeeded in his goal of stoking resentment against Romney, but he has also made himself into a very typical politician in the eyes of the electorate."

2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"Obama has been seeking this kind of base-versus-base election and his long, negative campaign has helped shove people into their respective camps sooner than usual."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,The president’s team believes that the power of incumbency combined with a superior turnout operation will allow them to win a narrow victory.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,But the alarming sign for the blue team is this: The president has failed to close the voter intensity gap for month after month.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,Romney supporters lead Obama supporters 64 percent to 54 percent on the question of whether it is “extremely important” for their candidate to win.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"In a tie race, that would mean victory for Romney."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,That’s why the president is trying to ring as many alarms for Democrats as he can.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"Talking about abortion is a risk for Democrats, who have seen public sentiment move away from their support for elective abortions."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,But Obama needs to get his voters marching.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"Maybe not the way they were in 2008, but enough not to get badly out-hustled."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"For Romney, the next week is all about reintroducing himself to a crabby and skeptical electorate."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"The first step came with his selection of Ryan as his running mate, helping cast Romney as a serious man and a serious fiscal conservative."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,The effort continues today in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which Romney told the story of his 25-year career as a corporate turnaround artist.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"He explained how he could use the same skills to remake the federal government, thereby stimulating the logy economy."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,And it will continue through the next week and through his acceptance speech in Tampa on Thursday.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"The message will be the same one we always expected from Romney: competency, accomplishment and steadiness."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"It’s not sexy, but it’s certainly a plausible presidential pedigree."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,Obama failed to land the kill shot on Romney before this final phase of the campaign begins.
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"If he wants to win, Romney needs to make the most of the next week."
2723,1,The Task in Tampa: Reintroducing Romney,"And Now, A Word From Charles “The media always had a liberal slant since the earth cooled."

2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"A tax system overhaul along the lines that Mitt Romney has proposed would give big tax cuts to high-income households and increase the tax burden on middle- and lower-income households, according to an analysis from economists at the Tax Policy Center."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"The researchers did not analyze the exact Romney plan, since it is incomplete and the researchers were reluctant to make assumptions until the campaign released more details."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"Instead they created a model for a revenue-neutral income tax change that incorporates some of Mr. Romney’s proposals, which include lowering marginal tax rates, eliminating both the alternative minimum tax and taxation of investment income of most taxpayers, doing away with the estate tax and repealing the additional high-income taxes passed with the Affordable Care Act."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"On their own, these cuts to personal income and estate taxes would reduce total tax revenue by $360 billion in 2015 relative to what is expected if current policies continued, according to the report."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"Mr. Romney has said that his plan will include offsets to the revenue lost through his proposed lower tax rates, although he has not said what kinds of policies would provide revenues to offset those cuts (that is, how he would come up with an additional $360 billion to compensate for the lost amount in tax revenue)."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,The analysis assumes that those offsets would be achieved chiefly through reducing or altogether eliminating other tax breaks — like the mortgage interest tax deduction or the child tax credit — and does not factor in spending cuts as a means to offset lost tax revenue.
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,The Tax Policy Center analysis assumed that the first tax breaks to go would be those that primarily affected the highest earners.
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"But even if all possible loopholes for households earning more than $200,000 were eliminated, this group would still be a net gainer under Mr. Romney’s plan, since the marginal tax rate decreases and other changes lop off much of its tax burden."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"As a result, middle- and lower-income households — the 95 percent of the population earning less than about $200,000 annually — would have to make up the difference, according to the review by the center, which is affiliated with the Brookings Institution."
2756,0,Plan Like RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Would Tax Rich Less,"“It is not possible to design a revenue-neutral plan that does not reduce average tax burdens and the share of taxes paid by high-income taxpayers under the conditions described above, even when we try to make the plan as progressive as possible,” write the study’s authors, Samuel Brown, William Gale and Adam Looney."

2756,0,Mitt Romney Promises 'Millions' Of Jobs -- But Offers No Data To Back It Up,"The Romney camp's retort, in a nutshell, is that Romney's plan would produce growth and jobs, and that Obama's plan would not because it is focused only on an ideological/political determination to make the wealthy pay more, and not on what would actually get the economy going."

2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"WASHINGTON -- It seems a distant memory when discussion of Barack Obama's fundraising revolved around the imminent possibility that the president, the record holder for money hauled in by a single candidate's campaign committee, would raise more than $1 billion for his reelection campaign."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"That isn't going to happen, as Obama campaign manager Jim Messina so elegantly admitted this past December."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"In fact, it's highly unlikely that Obama or his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, will meet or exceed Obama's 2008 record of $750 million."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,It isn't for want of trying.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,Obama's reelection effort is actually much closer to raising the same amount of money as his first campaign did than political reporters or his fundraising appeals would have you believe.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"A review of reports filed with the Federal Election Commission shows that the president has brought in $307 million for his campaign committee, known as Obama for America, through the end of June."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,That isn't far off the $339 million he raised over the same period of time in 2008.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Despite this slight disparity, the media, Republicans and the Obama campaign itself have issued harsh assessments of the president's fundraising throughout the course of the 2012 cycle."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"A recent Newsweek article discussed Obama's ""money worries,"" claiming the campaign will ""have to overcome a number of hurdles"" including the president's lack of interest in the ego-stroking required to raise political money -- this despite the president remaining the most successful fundraiser in modern history."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"CBS News called Obama's fundraising ""lackluster"" this past September."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"The myriad reports on Obama's supposedly poor fundraising come with a similarly varied list of reasons: He won't cater to the egos of big donors and offer them perks, Wall Street won't give to him because he has been mean, he just doesn't like fundraising and isn't very good at it, and -- the ever-present complaint -- enthusiasm is low and his much-vaunted small-donor machine isn't working quite like it did in 2008."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,All of these are either demonstrably incorrect or overblown.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Most of Obama's biggest bundlers in 2008 received appointments to ambassadorships, plum slots on arts, culture and humanities panels, or other government positions."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Wall Street might not be giving at the same clip as it did in 2008, but the financial sector has still supplied the campaign with nearly $11 million so far."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,The president has held more fundraisers than any other president in history at this point.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,And he's raising more from small donors than he did in 2008.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,The $30 million disparity between the record-setting Obama campaign of 2008 and that of 2012 appears to rest on two fairly mundane reasons.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"First, the reelection campaign's weakest fundraising months, in comparison to 2008, came in January and February, when the campaign raised $11.8 million and $21.3 million, respectively."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,That was way off the $36 million and $55 million that Obama raised in January and February 2008.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,The main reason for this disparity was the lack of a contested primary to focus donor giving this year.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"In 2008, Obama's victory in the Iowa caucus and subsequent loss to Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary fueled massive fundraising drives."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,Second is a factor perhaps too basic and boring to capture the attention of most of those analyzing the president's fundraising.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"The reelection campaign launched in April 2011, two months later than the comparable 2007 date when Obama took to a Springfield, Ill., stage to announce his presidential bid."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"In those two months in 2007, Obama raised $25 million."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Romney, on the other hand, is nowhere close to challenging Obama's 2008 record."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"The presumptive Republican nominee has raised $156 million through the end of June for his campaign committee, Romney for President."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Recent media reports have said that Romney has caught up with the president in fundraising, but they involve a slightly different comparison -- between all the political committees raising money for each presidential candidate."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"In Romney's case, that means also counting checks to the Republican National Committee and a joint fundraising vehicle, Romney Victory, that will send millions of dollars to a host of state-level party committees."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,Romney's official campaign committee has never beaten Obama's in fundraising for any period of time in the 2012 election cycle.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,Both campaigns combine their own fundraising with the amounts raised by their respective party committee and joint fundraising vehicles in their press releases announcing monthly totals.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,This gives the impression of much larger war chests than the official campaign committees actually have.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"It is true that, for all intents and purposes, money sent to the Republican and Democratic national committees will be spent to elect their respective nominees."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,And Romney and the RNC are currently outraising Obama's team.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"This was noted in a Tuesday email from Obama to his supporters: ""Over the past two months, we have been outraised by our opponents."""
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"In a Monday email solicitation, Vice President Joe Biden raised the same worry in stark terms: ""If we don't win this election, it will be because we didn't close the spending gap when we could."""
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"But federal rules that limit how the parties can spend their money, particularly on television ads, force the candidate committees to raise huge sums for themselves."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"The Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee are allowed to spend $21.7 million of the money they raise on so-called coordinated communications, which tend to be ads or other broadcast statements made under the direction of the presidential candidate's campaign."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"If a party wants to spend more than that advocating for the election of its candidate, it is required to create a ""independent"" committee to make independent expenditures."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,The RNC spent more than $50 million on independent expenditures in 2008 to help Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and has already launched an independent committee for 2012.
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"It's headed by Jim Murphy, a Republican strategist who consulted for Romney's 2002 gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Technically, this independent committee can spend the party's money, but cannot discuss strategy with anyone within the RNC privy to discussions with the Romney campaign."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"The Republican Party's independent committee has already made $13.1 million in independent expenditures, more than four times what its counterpart had spent at this point in 2008."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"The last time around, the DNC spent little on independent expenditures as the record-setting Obama campaign went up against the less well-funded McCain."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"This year, the Democrats' independent committee is expected to spend big in support of Obama and has even refused to transfer cash to the congressional party committees."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Of course, comparing Obama's fundraising to Romney's, or the DNC's money haul to the RNC's, does not tell the whole story this year."
2761,0,Barack Obama 2012 Fundraising Close To 2008 Record-Setting Pace,"Spending by independent groups, not officially affiliated with any candidate or party, will likely top $1 billion or more by Nov. 6."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,Get ready for this year’s “October Surprise” — the news event in the weeks before the presidential election that has the potential to push the remaining undecided voters behind one candidate and decide the outcome.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"Here’s a sneak peek at the “surprise.” In late October, President Obama announces his campaign is tapped out of money and unable to answer the final round of attack ads from his opponent, Mitt Romney."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,This scenario is no longer outside the realm of possibility.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"On a recent conference call with potential donors, President Obama said: “If things continue as they have so far, I’ll be the first sitting president in modern history to be outspent in his reelection campaign.” The president then asked his donors “to meet or exceed what you did in 2008.” That is a pretty high bar to clear."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"In 2008, Obama shattered all campaign fundraising records by bringing in more than $700 million."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"His GOP opponent, John McCain, raised only $316 million, giving the Democrat a tremendous advantage."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,It is a different ball game this time around.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"At the moment, President Obama’s campaign has $170 million in the bank while his GOP opponent, Mitt Romney, has $144 million."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,But the Romney money machine is gaining momentum.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,It raised more money than the Obama campaign in May and June.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"Romney’s donors also appear to have more money: Only 17 percent of Romney’s donations have been less than $200, compared to 40 percent of Obama’s donations that came in at less than $200."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,The big money going to Romney also has more ways than ever to avoid limits on donations.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"Keep in mind this is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United, which opened the floodgates for unlimited contributions to outside groups and created the super-PACs."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"Since January 2011, the GOP super-PACs have collected $228 million while Democratic super-PACs have deposited only $80 million."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"“Restore Our Future,” the super-PAC supporting Romney, now has $21.5 million in cash on hand."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"The super-PAC supporting the president, “Priorities USA,” has only $2.7 million in cash on hand."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,So the total dollars behind Romney already exceed the total dollars behind the president.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,And the money differential is showing up in the television advertising wars.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,The DNC has spent $12 million on advertising so far while the RNC has spent $11 million.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"But as of July 26, the pro-Romney “Restore Our Future” super-PAC has spent roughly $54 million on TV ads."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,The conservative American Crossroads/Crossroads GPS groups have spent a total of $94 million on TV ads.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,That is about five times the spending of all Democratic super-PACs combined.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"One point of optimism for the Democrats playing in this big money game is that the DNC and Obama campaign are sitting on $135 million in cash, slightly more than the $111.9 million Romney and the RNC have in the bank."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,But Obama’s campaign is burning through its money at a faster rate than the Romney team.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,The Obama campaign spent twice as much as the Republicans in June.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"The incumbent’s campaign purchased more TV ads, paid more than twice as many employees as Romney and spent millions of dollars on public opinion polls, according to FEC filings."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"In May and June combined, the Obama campaign spent 20 percent more than it took in, records show."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,The Wall Street Journal reports “some Democrats worry that the overhead built by the Obama camp over the past 15 months will prove impossible to sustain.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"Unless fundraising picks up, the Obama campaign may enter the season’s final stretch confronting hard choices: paring salaries, scaling back advertising or pulling out of swing states in a bid to control costs, these Democrats say.” In an interview with USA Today, Democratic strategist Mark Mellman said 80 percent of advertising dollars  are probably wasted, but there is no way to know it is a waste until the campaign is over."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"Of course, the Romney campaign is delighting in its fundraising advantage."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"One incredible fact of this 2012 campaign is that, without spending a dime on ads in swing states, the Romney campaign can still compete because of ads being paid for by pro-Romney super-PACs."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,"“You don’t want to be caught flat-footed and unable to close out a campaign,” Romney pollster Neil Newhouse told USA Today."
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,Indeed.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,Team Obama is already screaming for help from past donors to stave off any October shock.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,But will Democrats who once heard that the president might raise $1 billion for this campaign be convinced he is not playing the Shepherd Boy — who cried wolf so often that people stopped believing his calls for help.
2761,1,This is one October Surprise Obama surely sees coming,Right now the numbers show there really is a wolf at the Democrats’ door in the form of surging GOP money.

2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"3:12 p.m. | Updated  JERUSALEM â Mitt Romney found himself on the defensive yet again on his overseas trip, this time after offending Palestinian leaders with comments he made at a breakfast fund-raiser here on Monday."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"Speaking to roughly four dozen donors at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, Mr. Romney suggested that cultural differences between the Israelis and the Palestinians were the reason the Israelis were so much more economically successful than the Palestinians, without mentioning the impact that deep trade restrictions imposed by the Israeli government have had on the Palestinian economy."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,He also vastly understated the income disparities between the two groups.
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"In his speech, Mr. Romney mentioned two books that had influenced his thinking about nations â âGuns, Germs and Steel,â by Jared Diamond, and âThe Wealth and Poverty of Nations,â by David S. Landes."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"Mr. Diamondâs book, Mr. Romney said, argues that the physical characteristics of the land account for the success of the people living there, while Mr. Landesâs book, he continued, argues that culture is the defining factor."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"âCulture makes all the difference,â Mr. Romney said."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"âAnd as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things.â “As you come here and you see the G.D.P."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about $21,000, and compare that with the G.D.P."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality,” he said."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"In an interview with The Associated Press, Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, called Mr. Romneyâs remarks âracist.â “It is a racist statement and this man doesn’t realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,” Mr. Erekat said."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"“It seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people.â The Palestinians live under deep trade restrictions put in place by the Israeli government: After the militant group Hamas in 2007 took control of Gaza â home to about 1.7 million Palestinians â the Israelis imposed a near-total blockade on people and goods in Gaza."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"The blockade has been eased, and now many consumer goods are allowed in."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,But aid organizations say the restrictions still cripple Gazaâs economy.
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"The West Bank, where 2.5 million Palestinians reside, is also subject to trade restrictions imposed by the Israelis."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"In Gaza, according to the C.I.A., âIsraeli-imposed border closures, which became more restrictive after Hamas seized control of the territory in June 2007, have resulted in high unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and the near collapse of the private sector that had relied on export markets.â The agency added that âchanges to Israeli restrictions on imports in 2010 resulted in a rebound in some economic activity, but regular exports from Gaza still are not permitted.â And in the West Bank, âIsraeli closure policies continue to disrupt labor and trade flows, industrial capacity, and basic commerce, eroding the productive capacityâ of the economy."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"On Monday afternoon, Romney campaign officials did not respond to a query about whether Mr. Romney believes that the blockade of Gaza or trade restrictions in the West Bank have had any dampening effect on economic activity in those areas."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,Mr. Romney also understated the difference between per capita G.D.P.
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"by a wide margin, suggesting that Israelis produce about twice what Palestinians do."

2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"of the West Bank and Gaza was $2,900."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"Though Mr. Romney came to Israel to offer his support for the country, delivering a speech Sunday night in Jerusalem in which he offered a strong defense of Israelâs right to protect itself against the threat of a nuclear Iran, Mr. Romney also met Sunday with the Palestinian Authority’s prime minister, Salam Fayyad."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"In public, the two men made small talk about the London Olympics."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"After Mr. Romney’s remarks drew criticism, his campaign said that The Associated Press had âgrossly mischaracterizedâ the remarks by not providing the full context."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"For instance, the campaign said, after mentioning the per capita G.D.P."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"of Israel and Palestine, Mr. Romney also said: âAnd that is also between other countries that are near or next to each other."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"Chile and Ecuador, Mexico and the United States.â The comments Monday are the second time that Mr. Romney has unwittingly offended a group of people in a part of the world he was visiting."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"When he arrived in London on the first stop of his trip, Mr. Romney set off a media firestorm when he seemed to cast question on the cityâs preparedness for the Olympic Games."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"Obama campaign officials criticized Mr. Romneyâs latest remarks, describing them as the sort of thing that could make it more difficult for Mr. Romney to ever play a credible role in the Middle East peace process, which depends on having buy-in not from just Israelis but from Palestinian officials as well."
2763,0,Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,"American credibility and influence in that arena depend on âus being seen as an honest broker,â said Colin Kahl, an Obama campaign foreign policy adviser who served as the top Middle East policy official in the Pentagon from 2009 to 2011. âBut in this case, Romney fell off the tightrope pretty dramatically.â âIt was a really strange comment,â Mr. Kahl added, noting that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict encompasses âextraordinarily complicated and delicate issues and is not something you can just wing it on and expect not to make some mistakes, and Governor Romney made a big one.â"
2764,0,John McCain hits back at Dick Cheney,"Ariz. Sen. John McCain responded Monday to Dick Cheney’s criticism of his 2008 vice presidential pick with a dig of his own, saying he’s “always glad to get comments four years later” and noting he disagreed with the former vice president on the use of torture."

2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,As the country continued to mourn last week’s mass shooting in Colorado — President Obama visited victims’ families there Sunday — lawmakers reignited the debate about whether stricter gun-control laws would have prevented the movie theater massacre that left a dozen people dead.
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,Colorado Gov.
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"John Hickenlooper dodged a question by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” about whether Colorado should revisit its gun laws, saying that shooting suspect James Holmes would have found a way to create “horror” even if he hadn’t been able to acquire guns."
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,“This wasn’t a Colorado problem.
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"This is a human problem,” said Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat."
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"“Even if he didn’t have access to guns, this guy was diabolical, he would have found explosives, he would have found something else, some kind of poisonous gas."
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,He would have done something to create this horror.” White House press secretary Jay Carney said Sunday that Mr. Obama’s views on gun-control laws hasn’t changed.
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"“The president’s view is that we can take steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them under existing law,” Mr. Carney told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One to Colorado."
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"“And that’s his focus right now.” But gun-control advocates pointed to the types of weapons allegedly used by Mr. Holmes, a 24-year-old doctoral student at the University of Colorado, when the gunman in an Aurora theater at a Thursday midnight showing of the “The Dark Knight Rises” opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others."
2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"He was dressed in protective clothing that moviegoers assumed was a costume — a common thing to do at superhero movies on opening weekend — and was armed with a 100-round rifle magazine, along with other weapons."

2768,1,Shootings renew fire at gun-law adequacy,"But like Mr. Hickenlooper, Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, insisted the issue wasn’t about guns, but about an individual who would have found a way to carry out acts of violence no matter what tools were available to him."

2775,0,Supreme Court rules in indecency case,"“In terms of the issue of whether the commission can continue to have an indecency policy at all and whether that indecency policy is constitutional as established, [those] are left for another day.” At issue before the court was a series of court findings sparked by the FCC’s decision to change the indecency rules following rock star Bono’s impromptu utterance during his acceptance speech at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards on NBC."
2775,0,Supreme Court rules in indecency case,"During the broadcast, Bono said, “This is really, really f—ing brilliant.” Following the Golden Globes, the commission in 2004 decided that broadcasters could be fined for airing a “fleeting expletive.” Since the commission changed its rules, it decided not to fine NBC at the time."

2775,1,"Supreme Court rules against FCC profanity, nudity policy","But, following several awards shows with cursing celebrities in 2002 and 2003, the FCC toughened its policy after it concluded that a one-free-expletive rule did not make sense in the context of keeping the air waves free of indecency when children are likely to be watching television."

2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"Updated 06/20/2012 04:57 PM EDT The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Wednesday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena in the “Fast and Furious” investigation, setting up a legal showdown with President Barack Obama in the middle of his tough reelection battle."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"Within minutes, Republican leaders announced plans for a vote of the full House on the contempt resolution."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"Story Continued Below The dramatic committee action came after Holder asserted executive privilege over some of the documents sought by the House panel, which is chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.)."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"But GOP lawmakers weren’t swayed, and they proceeded with the contempt vote despite bitter objections from the White House, Justice Department and Democratic lawmakers."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,Speaker John Boehner and other top Republicans went so far as to suggest the White House was using executive privilege to cover up its involvement in Fast and Furious.
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,Issa and his fellow GOP lawmakers on the Oversight panel defeated several Democratic amendments seeking to revise or water down the contempt resolution and its accompanying report.
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"Republicans then pushed through the chairman’s measure, the gist of which was leaked weeks ago, on a 23-17 vote."

2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"”While we had hoped it would not come to this, unless the Attorney General reevaluates his choice and supplies the promised documents, the House will vote to hold him in contempt next week,” Boehner and Cantor said."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"“If, however, Attorney General Holder produces these documents prior to the scheduled vote, we will give the Oversight Committee an opportunity to review in hopes of resolving this issue.” Holder issued his own statement after the vote blasting Issa."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"“This divisive action does not help us fix the problems that led to this operation or previous ones and it does nothing to make any of our law enforcement agents safer,” Holder said."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"“It’s an election-year tactic intended to distract attention — and, as a result — has deflected critical resources from fulfilling what remains my top priority at the Department of Justice: Protecting the American people.” The Oversight panel’s vote, and Obama administration’s move to invoke executive privilege, is similar to battles between President George W. Bush and Democrats over the extent of presidential power."
2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"It sets up a much more serious debate over the authority of the executive and legislative branches as it relates to the botched gun surveillance program, which allowed Mexican drug cartels to obtain roughly 2,000 weapons from U.S. gun dealers."

2776,0,Fast and Furious: GOP suggests White House cover-up,"Democrats slammed Issa for his handling of the probe, saying a legitimate congressional inquiry has now turned into a personal power struggle between him and Holder, as well as an opportunity for Issa to get headlines and TV time."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"President Obama could be on shaky legal ground with his assertion of executive privilege in a congressional investigation that has been going on for a year, according to scholars who study the limits of presidential power."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"Louis Fisher, a former specialist on the separation of powers at the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, said he found the administration’s arguments “extremely unpersuasive.” Mr. Fisher noted that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in a letter to the president, cited the need to protect the Justice Department’s “deliberative process” in responding to the congressional inquiry into a botched gun-running operation."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“Yet he admits throughout his letter to Obama that the department has regularly provided the House committee with documents” involved in drafting a particular letter to the committee on Feb. 4, 2011, Mr. Fisher said."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“He states that the department ‘has already shared with the Committee over 1,300 pages of documents concerning the drafting of the Feb. 4 letter,’ ” Mr. Fisher said."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“In short, Holder was willing to release documents about that deliberative process.” Mr. Fisher, who has testified before Congress and written a book about executive privilege, also said Mr. Holder repeatedly cites “the fundamentally false notion that when Congress wants information from the executive branch, it must be in furtherance of a ‘legitimate legislative responsibility.’ “ “The constitutional right of Congress to pursue oversight — is as legitimate as its legislative function,” Mr. Fisher said."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“Oversight is also essential in investigating corruption and illegal activity in the executive branch.” ‘Not to be lightly invoked Documents requested by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell E. Issa, California Republican, in the “Fast and Furious” gun-running operation “should not qualify for executive privilege,” said Maureen Martin, senior fellow for legal affairs at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think-tank based in Chicago."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“The Supreme Court has held that executive privilege is ‘an extraordinary assertion of power not to be lightly invoked,’” she said in a statement."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,“It is intended to safeguard deliberations in the executive branch over what course of action to take.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"That was decided long ago as far as Fast and Furious is concerned.” But Steven D. Schwinn, an associate professor of law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said he believes Mr. Obama’s claim of privilege is valid."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“The committee appears to seek material relating to purely internal executive deliberations about how to respond to committee and press inquiries, and not to the substance of the program and other matters,” Mr. Schwinn said."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“Largely for the reasons that the attorney general gives in his letter to the president, I think he’s right that this material is covered by executive privilege as against the committee’s request for it.” The White House defended its assertion of executive privilege Wednesday, saying Mr. Obama has used the tactic only once, far less than his predecessors."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"But scholars say what matters in court is the legal validity of presidential claims of privilege, not their frequency."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"The move also was awkward for a president who claims to be running for re-election as having the most transparent administration in history, and it opened up a new front in Mr. Obama’s ongoing feud with congressional Republicans."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,Previous examples A court decision from the administration of former President Bill Clinton is considered one of the most definitive on the subject of presidential privilege.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"The case involved then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who came under investigation by an independent counsel in 1994 over accusations of improper gifts."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"(He resigned and was indicted, but was acquitted.)"
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"A grand jury subpoenaed a report that the White House counsel’s office had prepared for Mr. Clinton on the Espy case, and Mr. Clinton cited executive privilege in refusing to turn over some of the documents."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"A federal appeals court decision in 1997 made clear that such claims are limited to White House officials, according to the CRS."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“The court’s opinion carefully distinguishes between the ‘presidential communications privilege’ and the ‘deliberative process privilege,’” the CRS report stated."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“Both, the court observed, are executive privileges designed to protect the confidentiality of executive branch decisionmaking."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"But the deliberative process privilege, that applies to executive branch officials generally, is a common law privilege which requires a lower threshold of need to be overcome, and ‘disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct has occurred.’” Mr. Holder and a top deputy defended the claim by saying the documents are not relevant to the original Fast and Furious operation, and that turning over such documents would have a chilling effect on the ability of a president’s top aides to give him advice confidentially."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,A White House spokesman said Mr. Obama “has gone longer without asserting the privilege in a congressional dispute” than any other president in the past three decades.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"The White House said President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege six times, while President Bill Clinton did so 14 times."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"Mr. Bush asserted executive privilege to block release of documents and testimony under oath by top White House aides, including White House counsel Harriet Miers, concerning the administration’s firing of nine federal prosecutors in 2006."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"Those aides later gave testimony in private, under a deal arranged by the Obama administration."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,Obama’s past words But the use of that privilege is one that Mr. Obama tried to exploit as a candidate for president.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"In 2007, then-Sen. Obama criticized Mr. Bush for trying to “hide” behind executive privilege in the case of the fired U.S. attorneys."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“There’s been a tendency, on the part of this administration, to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there’s something a little shaky that’s taking place,” Mr. Obama told CNN’s Larry King."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,“I think the administration would be best served by coming clean on this.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"There doesn’t seem to be any national security issues involved.” He added, “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for not offfering up some clear plausible rationale for why these U.S. attorneys were targeted when by all assessments they were doing an outstanding job."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"I think the American people deserve to know what was going on there.” A White House aide said the executive privilege claim was in response to a congressional investigation that is “all politics.” Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat said claims of privilege should be used sparingly."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"But he said in this case, the administration was “forced into this position by the committee’s unreasonable insistence on pressing forward with contempt despite the attorney general’s good faith offer.” Presidents typically cite executive privilege to protect aides within the White House under the reasoning that a president’s closest advisers should be able to give their advice freely in private."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,White House involved?
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,But Mr. Obama’s assertion of executive privilege in the Justice Department’s “Fast and Furious” operation has critics questioning whether the president himself became involved in the internal discussions about the administration’s response to the probe.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"“Until now, everyone believed that the decisions regarding ‘Fast and Furious’ were confined to the Department of Justice,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,“The White House decision to invoke executive privilege implies that White House officials were either involved in the ‘Fast and Furious’ operation or the cover-up that followed.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,The Administration has always insisted that wasn’t the case.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"Were they lying, or are they now bending the law to hide the truth?” Mr. Buck said."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"It’s also an uncomfortable position for a president who hails his administration’s transparency, for example, in matters such as releasing White House visitor logs."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"As a candidate, Mr. Obama pledged to enforce “a new standard of openness.” “We’re constantly trying to open up the process,” Mr. Obama said in January 2010."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"When he was campaigning for the presidency in 2007, Mr. Obama promised to reserve the use of executive privilege for cases of national security or “traditionally sensitive matters.” In 2004, Mr. Fisher noted, the George W. Bush administration initially refused to allow National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to testify in public before the 9/11 Commission."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales argued that the separation of powers were at stake, but he reversed himself and allowed Miss Rice to testify."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"During Mr. Bush’s presidency, the Republican tried to greatly expand presidential powers, both to prevent disclosure of internal White House communications and to disregard portions of laws with which he didn’t agree."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"Mr. Clinton claimed executive privilege to try to shield his wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, from questions about the Whitewater real estate scandal and the Monica Lewinsky affair."
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,Courts rejected his claims in both cases.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,A report in 2008 by CRS said the administrations of Presidents George H.W.
2776,1,White House defends privilege claim,"Bush and Mr. Clinton took the position that executive privilege extended to recommendations made to senior officials and communications of senior policymakers throughout the executive branch, including within the White House or between the White House and any federal department or agency."

2778,0,Obama: No deportation of some young illegal immigrants,"“As long as I’m president, I will not give up on this issue, not only because it’s the right thing to do for our economy … not just because it’s the right thing to do for our security, but because it’s the right thing to do period,” he said."

2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"In a speech his campaign billed as a reset after a series of stumbles and a string of bad economic news, President Obama stuck to a long-established script Thursday with the only new line shifting the onus on voters to break open the partisan deadlock in Washington."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"Focusing the choice away from his record in office, Mr. Obama fell back on his familiar refrain of casting himself as the champion of the middle class and warning of the slash-and-burn tactics that he says presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would put into place if elected — what he called two starkly different visions for fixing the economy."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"“What’s holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction America should take, and this election is your chance to break that stalemate,” Mr. Obama said Thursday in lengthy remarks at Cuyahoga Community College outside Cleveland."

2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"“There is one place I stand in complete agreement with Mr. Romney,” Mr. Obama said."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"“This election is about our economic future.” He said Mr. Romney’s economic plan consists mainly of trillions of dollars more in tax cuts, severe spending cuts, and lifting regulations on corporations, but claims to be the only candidate committed to protecting middle-income workers and saving programs they depend on to help pay their bills, keep down health care costs and send their children to college."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"Moments earlier, about 250 miles away in Cincinnati, Mr. Romney delivered a stinging rebuke of the president’s record on handling the economy, accusing the president of being “long on words and short on action” with unemployment figures still topping 8 percent."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"The president’s re-election campaign decided to have Mr. Obama deliver a major economic address “because he hasn’t delivered a recovery for the economy,” he said."

2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,“The Democrats are saying something like this: ‘We found a big hole that we did not dig.

2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"You may have heard I recently made my own unique contribution to that process.” Despite criticism in recent weeks from high-profile Democrats that Mr. Obama must do more than blame former President George W. Bush and the economic crisis he inherited from his predecessor, the president hewed closely to that theme Thursday."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"In painstaking detail, Mr. Obama denounced the Bush-era economic and policy choices that Mr. Obama said Mr. Romney and Republicans support even though they led to the global economic crisis of late 2008 — tax cuts for the wealthy, deficit spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and deregulation that allowed banks and corporations to run wild and swindle consumers."

2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"Both Mr. Obama’s and Mr. Romney’s campaigns have dumped more money into Ohio than other states, and their dueling visits Thursday show just how strongly the two are competing for the state’s 18 electoral votes."
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,Ohio has played a critical role in determining the winner in the past few presidential contests.
2779,1,Obama tells Ohioans he champions the middle,"Mr. Obama won the state in 2008, and Mr. Bush took it in 2004."
